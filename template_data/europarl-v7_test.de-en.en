I myself have been able to learn a great deal and therefore hope that the chamber will support this proposal in full.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, time and again this Parliament has had to struggle with a very lax attitude to democracy on the part of the European Council.
I am in favour of this resolution because its main aim is to ensure the highest level of security for populations following disasters like the one that happened recently in Japan.
All the more, it is unacceptable to leave the process in the hands of multinationals, because the interests they represent are not the best guarantee of respect for the integrity of human life.
Mr President, I would also like to pass on my best regards to Mr Karlsson, thank him for his presentation and all the work he has done over the past few years.
This is unfortunate, and I will obviously be asking for a reason in certain cases: in the specific case of Italy, for example, it has requested more time to respond.

Debate in Poland is dominated by squabbles between two parties.
Pakistan has been at the forefront of this battle, sometimes carrying a very heavy burden on behalf of the international community, a heavy burden sometimes carried on weak shoulders, a burden the people of Pakistan have carried, absorbing so much violence and carnage which would otherwise have made its way into other parts of the world.
It stimulated a debate, and society itself took charge of it.

This proposal thus gives added impetus to the stabilisation and association process.
   Certain vulnerable parts of the world attract more attention from the international community than others.
These jobs often lack correct contracts and social benefits.
I see no reason why this preamble should not be removed from the Border Treaty as the Tartu Peace Treaty is still a valid international treaty and the new Border Treaty only acknowledges the control line between Estonia and Russia, their border, and the external border of the European Union.
I would like to hear from the Commission that it will intervene not merely by recommending better labelling and better testing - though, of course, we need that - but by taking action to outlaw these activities, which are a total fraud on the public and are likely in one respect to cause serious concern, because the injection of beef protein - which the perpetrators admit has come from countries where there is BSE, and they have not tested the products for that - may cause serious public concern as well.
The pathological hunt to locate the contamination site led to premature accusations of guilt all round, and these arguments led to days of negative headlines and total uncertainty on the part of consumers.
The first aspect concerns competition.
   . – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue we are discussing today is one of the most important – I believe most important – pre-legislative proposals on the EU agenda for this parliamentary term.

Demographic changes present not only serious challenges but also new opportunities.
Our calls have fallen upon deaf ears.
With regard to the translation problem, what Mrs Schleicher is referring to is a very important factor as the terminology is indeed highly technical in this field and a suitable translation is essential.

Mr Johannes Swoboda agreed with me.
Anything else would have infringed the subsidiarity principle.
I must also stress that these local labour markets are incredibly important for quality of life and social welfare in various ways.
One more question for Mrs Fischer Boel: what is your view of such a certification system?
In 1997, the Commission will set in motion farreaching reforms designed to modernize the way it is run and to improve its performance.
Reduction in working hours (continuation)
Perhaps the biggest problem here is transport safety, which involves securing the social conditions of employees, including cases where aircraft are hired out together with crews, as well as the safety of passengers, who are traditionally the priority.
Although EU agricultural policy aims to provide safe, high-quality food products and contributes to the protection of the environment and to renewable energies, it must be adequately financed so as to encourage farmers to use modern, environmentally sound techniques.

On the title, Amendment No 1, it is the Commission's view that it is better that we stick to the more general terms of the original proposal.
We would therefore argue that, in those quite specific cases, in other words not as a general rule but in those specific cases, a description of the CVs and experience of the staff should suffice.
We, the radicals, have introduced a little amendment so that, unless the situation in that country changes drastically, if no privatization or political reform is carried out there, it will be put under international supervision in six months, because it not only does not guarantee liberty, it does not even guarantee bread for its inhabitants.
I should also like to compliment Mr Mulder on his work.
Let us go the right way.

I note that, on certain points, it has been said that action must be taken on the UK’s rebate.
Otherwise, we could soon be voted down in this House.
The use of the heavy metals mercury, cadmium and lead in batteries must be limited as far as possible. Parliament must therefore tighten up the Council proposal now before us.

As to Mrs Müller's request, once the legislation is adopted my services will organise a hearing with a view to adequately implement Article 2(2), where all stakeholders will be given the possibility to have input.

That is why we have the intention - and this will be important for Parliament - to submit a mid-term review of the implementation of the Stockholm Programme in 2012, in order to ensure that the programme remains in line with European and global developments.
On the other hand, I have my reservations on how much we should go on discussing the extension of competences, even regarding decisions taken through codecision in the field of legal immigration when there is still so much to do in the field of illegal immigration, especially in countries directly facing the problems and burdens of illegal immigration.
Therefore, I was disappointed that what is otherwise a good and important report calls into question what is for me a fundamental principle of something being done in return in terms of free and human rights, and the opportunity for peacekeeping operations within the European Investment Fund.

Moreover, Afghanistan is not the only country where the rights of women are violated on a massive scale.
Madam President, I am sure that nobody here is suffering an attack of Alzheimer' s, but that some people are surely seeking to manipulate this Parliament for reasons of party politics in their own countries, which I believe we should all oppose, Madam President.

Mr President, thank you for your sincere words concerning Mrs Anna Lindh.

Parliament will be able to reach a far more balanced verdict on it in the next one.
It is inadmissible that those who shoot civilian demonstrators be called heroes of the nation and promised an amnesty.
The flooding caused severe damage to the agricultural sector, residential properties and businesses, to the road network and to other infrastructure.
As stressed in the resolution, it will have to start by satisfying certain basic needs of the people, such as running water, housing and medical care, otherwise it will clearly be unable to push ahead with other reforms because it will not have the consent of the people.
Here too there has been enough talking: it is high time for action!
I would like to ask the Commissioner to continue with her annual reports but to come to us on a regular basis so that we can help her improve utilization by putting pressure on the Member States, so that we can take swift action when bottlenecks and obstacles occur.
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes
In my report on EU-India Trade and Economic Relations, I called on 'both India and Pakistan to further reduce administrative impediments to implementing trade-related confidence-building measures and for the EU to offer technical assistance, if required, in this regard'.
Clearly there is a lot that can be done in Europe.
Member States must be able to maintain their right to take decisions on energy and exploit their own energy sources, but at the same time we need cooperation, an exchange of best experience and also common rules and regulations to promote the establishment of a common energy policy.
In areas with lower yields, in addition to agricultural activity, the economic activities linked to it would also disappear, and this would create unprecedented problems in economic, social, environmental and land planning terms.
In your task force report, you indicated your support and that of the Commission for the local devolved administration and the work that it is doing in securing a peaceful and prosperous future for the people of Northern Ireland.
I just want to know what the reason for this is.

   – Mr President, the aim of the resolution is to prepare the guidelines before the conference to revise the Treaty of Non-Proliferation.

I am grateful to Parliament for having understood this and for having supported us as it has done.

We talk about improving the quality of training in Parliament.
Import of poultry carcases (debate)
As regards Pakistan, which is the subject of the resolution we are now discussing, I want to say that the GUE/NGL Group supports the resolution in its entirety.
It is not possible for us to stand before our electorate with our heads held high and say that we have succeeded in regulating this netherworld effectively.
I will not go into them all.
Mr Alyssandrakis, I do not agree with you that Cyprus' accession, in the form currently proposed, will mean a de jure division of the island.
At the last meeting of the Governing Council at the beginning of June, which was devoted to our stance on monetary policy, this led us to the conclusion that the risks are there, the mitigating effects seem to be emerging, and we must wait and see how things develop.
We proposed that last Thursday.
If the Commission does nothing else after today's debate, I hope it will seek to establish a level playing field and seek to remove gross state aids such as those practised in Holland which I believe are grossly unfair.
All its other advantages - from transport to energy production - can only be secondary in the light of the importance of water as a strategic commodity.
10. Rear registration plate of two or three-wheel motor vehicles (vote)
Sixteen new priority projects have been added to what was until recently 14, in order to take account of the accession of the new EU Member States.
Madam President, in support of the urgent procedure, and to specifically respond to this point, I would like to repeat that this is not a case of Parliament giving its opinion on a list.
Concerning Mrs Oddy's proposal to consider the possibility of putting Mary Robinson in charge of a special mission aimed at promoting a rapprochement between the two sides and to put an end to the conflict which is raging in the country, I am completely open to this proposal.
The Commission will continue to take all necessary measures, firstly to help Turkey in its fight against torture and ill-treatment, and secondly in order to monitor current developments.
Can the Commission indicate to what extent this matter has been considered at EU level and, if so, how does the Commission consider this type of crime can be effectively dealt with?
For this reason we are particularly delighted that the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 8 April has taken into account the difficulties in applying this directive encountered by a large number of, mainly small, companies, and also by many economic sectors in the search for a compromise on limit values and on the implementation deadline for the requirements imposed by the new directive on companies.
I do not know why you denied me the opportunity to speak.
China should do the same in Tibet as Slovakia does for its Hungarian minority, with Hungarian minority children able to study in Hungarian from nursery school through to primary school and secondary school.
However, there are no actual examples and I wonder whether that is because, under examination, they would not stand up against the strained argument that is put forward - an argument against a non-member state, based on an old free trade agreement, designed primarily to deal with the trade in goods.
Mr President, a while ago, one Member quite rightly condemned cloning in this plenary and called for it to be universally rejected.
We need the 12-day rule for occasional cross-border coach services.
It is therefore the same thing, but our legal experts thought that it was better to word it in this way.
The Dayton Agreement must be implemented.
This conflict had been smouldering for years.
This is the case for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.
The notes fall within the competence of the European Central Bank, and Mr Trichet will say what he needs to say on behalf of the Bank.
Then there is the clean slate, a provision that ends the unfortunate practice of deducting advances from featured artists' royalties.
That will lead to not only more deaths on the road, but to health problems for the hauliers themselves.
I believe every effort should continue to be made, because any deferment, any delay, would have a serious negative impact on public opinion in the acceding state and only encourage those interests most opposed to reform.
I was told it was not a committee delegation in a letter from the chairman, Mrs D'Ancona, and I merely informed the government of the Member State that it was not a committee delegation.
The soldiers' bodies were identified through DNA a few weeks ago after they were killed 35 years ago and thrown down a well in the occupied northern part of the island.
Far from being the symbol of a new post-Soviet Europe, the euro is, on the contrary, the supreme symbol of a construction of Europe which was conceived during and out of the Cold War, and which has not been able to reconsider its foundations and objectives in the light of the new geopolitical situation.
For future growth, making a living must not equate to making a killing.
Waste on the green list is waste whose transfer is generally not considered to pose any risk to the environment.
I can tell the Council representative that while we welcome the adoption of a convention, Parliament will not support a system of options.
Now that we want sustainable development to be given a leading place in the new Treaty, there will be a legal base for the purpose of this report: research serving sustainability.
The inspectors' reports to the Security Council are conclusive in terms of the non-compliance with Resolution 1441.
If anybody has a point of order, they can put it.
On the other hand, there are other problems such as the definition of the concept of higher education and the balance between article 3 - recognition of diplomas per se - and article 4 which, in certain circumstances, enables the Member States to introduce additional requirements.
in writing. - (FR) The adoption of this decision is a decisive step towards reinforcement of the internal electronic communications market.
Consequently, few demands are made as regards the policy changes required.
I shall deal with only four of them.
For example, I believe that Europol is an important tool which, combined with an effective network of experts and a special unit whose members have had training on very specific issues, can be used to combat child pornography and prostitution.
He was a Vice-President and Director of US investment bank Goldman Sachs, where his responsibilities included Europe and contact with the national governments there.
The high-speed rail network between Munich and Verona is a case in point: the cost and the environmental impact of the Brenner tunnel are such that this project is not feasible, even according to the governments of the countries concerned, Germany, Austria and Italy.
Finally, I should like to point out that the global financial crisis is now one year old.
Given that the agreed text is acknowledged as better than the Council general approach, this does not make sense.
Is that not the method that promises success?
In particular I should like to thank Gerry Collins for his warm welcome.
The Bösch report, which follows on from the Special Report of the Court of Auditors on the running of the Commission's Unit for the Coordination of Fraud Prevention (UCLAF), presents overwhelming conclusions. During the 10 years this unit has existed, it has not managed to finalise its procedural rules, nor to obtain the independence and security in handling information that would be needed for effective financial control.
Our poor economic growth is largely home-made: 'made in Europe'.
If a declaration was made but not recorded in the Minutes, we shall look into the matter.
It is now customary, with each presidency, for the Defence Minister to attend a parliamentary sitting. This marks real progress.
We came to the conclusion that in 1996 5.4 % of the events on which payments were based were associated with serious errors, and we point out that the error rate in the field of structural assistance is above average, and in the field of agricultural policy it is below average.
I should like to point out as rapporteur that certain proposals of the Agriculture Committee ought to be re-examined to get things in proportion.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I share the assessment of the rapporteur, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, concerning the problems of dependence on imports and the growing dependence on imports of energy fuels and I have little disagreement with it - the report describes it very well.
The regulation also makes specific reference to the needs of indigenous and forest-dependent people and the need for gender considerations to be taken into account.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the total for Category 5, administrative expenditure, has been set at EUR 4.7 billion, with an increase of 4 % - or EUR 182 million - over 1998.
   . I certainly concur with the question the honourable Member has put to me in terms of the need to delineate between legislation where it is appropriate and, indeed, where there are areas where there are alternatives to regulation that should be considered.
Now those formulas must be applied.
This primarily involves health care, including clinical and preventive research and medical technologies.
Finally, it seems to me that perhaps the most important thing we have to do - which is a challenge ahead of us - is to influence and change public opinion on the need for conservation and efficiency.
The second point is that these reports refer to 1999.
A third issue in this context concerned the fact that we wanted to ensure that these nominal quantities would not be abolished automatically after a certain time, but that the European Commission would assess the consequences and the possibilities beforehand and would consider by means of an impact assessment whether this was appropriate, what consequences could arise as a result and how we might respond to any disruption of the market.
However, there does have to be responsibility on all Member States - those in the north and also those in the south - to properly implement EU law on the reception of migrants and on the processing of claims with financial and other help, and also on integration and the enforcement of labour laws.
Your report has been dealt with, Mr Pex, and I am not going to continue this discussion because it is not a matter for the House to decide on at the moment, since it is not on the agenda.
Directives need to be changed, but so do attitudes.
This report is a microcosm of Paolo Costa's work, because it is a report that clearly shows that the wisdom of Solomon, allied to the diplomatic skills of the United Nations, is often needed when dealing with such technical details like 'use it or lose it on the slot'.

There is nothing even-handed in equating, no matter how justified they are, the political demands of Gaza with the vicious and repeated terrorist attacks on Israel as epitomised by the attack on the school.
No doubt there are indeed problems involving human rights, interest rate policy and environmental standards, but they must not be solved through protectionism.
There is no respect for women's rights; for example, women are prevented from observing International Women's Day publicly.
A little more conservatism in the calculations would not have gone amiss.
We need be very wary of wealthy business interests controlling the flow of information and pushing a self serving market driven, anti-regulation, and, often, anti-Trade Union agenda.
Once again, I would like to congratulate all fellow Members who serve on the committee, and I would like Mr Harbour to accept these thanks and congratulations on their behalf.
Thank you, Mr President.
Although it is in a minority in numerical terms, the European Union nevertheless plays a leading role in the Council and has established itself as a major player.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, with this discussion the sport of figure skating comes to mind.
I have to put to you: do you have the courage to act on your convictions and on this Parliament's beliefs?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness.
Only lack of confidence can explain the fact that, despite high company profits, lower interest rates and reduced company taxes, investment has failed to materialize, especially in the private sector. And it is not encouraging that the rate of public investment has also fallen, from 3.5 % to less than 2.5 % of GDP.
From this point of view, this agreement between the European Union and Georgia is a very important one.
Things that are not understood will of course not make much sense.
In Mr Newman's report on the Ombudsman's annual report there are four main questions that I would like to comment on briefly.
Shall I ask the Commission if it is prepared to make its declaration?

The Commission can support this course of action, as it increases legal certainty and also improves environmental safeguards.
Mr President, the Amsterdam Treaty sets new standards for health policy in Europe.
The obligation to intervene, invented to support causes that were far less just, must be applied to the Middle East with determination and steadfastness.

The hinterland is rural, arable farmland and pasture, without many SMEs.
on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, as a standing rapporteur on relations with Russia, may I inform you that we have already launched a very thorough process in order to deal with all the serious matters which are important in our relations with Russia.
The rapporteur is right in calling for an effective system to control imported canned goods from third countries and the origin of products, a definite policy of quality which should be combined with an adequate promotional campaign.
If we want to prevent tragedies such as those at Dover from happening again, extending the Third Pillar should not be delayed any further, and we are hopeful after President Chirac' s address and Minister Queyranne' s speech.
You have stood by your word.
I should like to repeat here what I said at the Conference of Presidents on behalf of my group.
Mr Poettering himself said in a television interview that the presence in the Commission of Mrs Kroes, who has so many scandals behind her, would not be tolerated.

According to the Swedish government's interpretation of the decision taken at Cologne in 1999, a relevant UN Security Council resolution has to have been adopted.
I wonder what further urgent comments the European Parliament should now have to make on this.
Mr President, excuse my lateness. I see, however, that my name is not on the list of members present.
The outcome cannot be described as something that has produced a simplification of legislation in Europe, quite the opposite, it has all become more bureaucratic, more complicated, harder to understand and more inefficient, the opposite of ‘slim’, I would call the directive ‘thick’, to borrow the English word.
Secondly, a topic fundamental to Parliament as an institution. From the institutional point of view Mr Costa has managed to increase comitology in relation to methods of scanning and I believe that in future this too will put right a few misunderstandings which have arisen in the past, for example in relation to liquids; this is another area where I believe we must improve.
However, while the many advantages are both immediate and conspicuous, I welcome more than anything else the fact that the FTA has an effective bilateral safeguard mechanism - a safeguard that allows the EU to restore MFN duty rates, should it be that this particular FTA has led to or threatens to cause serious injury to EU domestic industry.
12. European Quality Assurance Reference Framework for Vocational Education and Training (
The Commissioner claims that, strictly speaking, it is possible, even under current procedures, for these businesses to claim damages.

Administrative exclusion and preferential treatment for individual groups is not a path towards social inclusion, but towards continued social exclusion.
As the rapporteur has clearly said, the two worlds are distinguished because of the poverty which exists in the developing world.
Why can the Council not take it up and approve it?
However, I should perhaps be more moderate in my views tonight.
I believe it is essential to extend this fund's scope for intervention to pollution caused by noxious and hazardous substances.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, many in this House will remember that at first reading, this was an extremely hot topic, and I think we are hearing only some of the differences between us.
Since you mention sport, I had a look at the French newspapers this morning, wondering what they would write today about Mr Sarkozy's visit to the European Parliament.
I have heard that it has become a little bit passé to speak of peace to generations in Europe who have never known war.
This federal assistance is supplanted by US state and local government support to Boeing in the form of tax breaks, favourable real estate and local infrastructure improvements intended to secure the company's presence and job base in selected US cities.
Indeed, that would be the result of the current proposal if it were not amended.
Imposing such a sunset clause is clearly not in line with the recent agreement on the revised comitology procedure.
There are alternatives and the only way we will achieve them is to impose a ban.
I believe that is a reasonable measure which the European Union can support, but which it must support jointly with others, in particular the United States and the Russian Federation.

From the time of the first reading of the reports in the European Parliament up to the Berlin European Council at the end of March, Parliament influenced and modified the results in the course of intensive discussions, and in intensive negotiations after Berlin.
In 2000 the target for the appointment of women to A1 was two appointments and the target for A2 was five appointments.
All I can do is mention the Swedish law prohibiting the purchase of sexual services and, of course, the Austrian legislation.
I would ask her - although she is no longer here - whether not labelling something that was 100% composed of GMOs would mean that we were being more politically honest with consumers.
The world needs to understand, for one thing, that peace does not come through immigration but through self-reliant development and, for another, that real proletarianisation sets in when people lose their cultural roots.
My second point is that this is probably a European record in terms of efficiency, because I do not know of a major legislative package which was introduced on Valentine's Day - 14 February - 2007 by the Commission and approved by Coreper on 13 February 2008 - one day under a year.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Can we try to find some way of conveying our views to the Russian Government and sorting out this question of freedom of the press and expression which bedevils relations between the Russian Federation and the European Union?
It will clearly not be easy to find a balanced and equitable solution in this very complex situation and, frankly, the Commission will need a fair amount of ingenuity and flexibility in order to lead this case to a solution acceptable for the Member States and the economic operators.

At European level, we have laid down minimum rules with which all Member States and all enterprises must comply in the event of large-scale job reductions or other measures potentially affecting workers.
This does not mean structures of aggression, but structures which actively build peace. Painfully, we failed to do this in advance of the Iraq war, but it has been the European Union's mission since our founding fathers started it up in 1952.
More than 20 directives have been adopted that follow this approach, a concrete example of which is the Machinery Directive.
The first is the issue of our own working methods.
I do not think so.
This might be supported by the addition of texts in an article of the proposal, but the reference in the explanatory memorandum should be sufficient.
I should like to see the EU push further ahead with this in the context of climate protection, and I hope that we can convince all the other major competing airlines to join this agreement.
My group believes that we should in fact do this as often as we possibly can. There is one category in which this it is difficult to do so and I intend to take this up again at a later stage.
I would have liked to hear from the Commission whether it would also be possible to discuss this with non-EU countries, but the Council is absent, unfortunately.
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically, resulting in a loss of jobs.
I fear however we have failed as an institution in the manner in which we have scrutinised the Prodi Commission, which has been unstructured, insufficiently in-depth and inconsistent.
For this very reason, it may be regarded as an important step forward that the European Parliament will shortly adopt the report on the gas market.
Mr Souaidia said that the generals, who are the real politicians and decision-makers, have killed thousands of people for no reason at all.
Mr Malerba and other Members have participated in such events in the past, and we very much hope that this practice will continue
I shall confine my speech this evening to some comments about the new stage that was reached on this road on Sunday 30 July, during the first round of the presidential elections, which coincided with the legislative elections.
My second point is that in Recital B, read it ladies and gentlemen, Western forces are forces of occupation.
Those with the fastest guns and the slowest reflexes to ideals and institutions cannot take the law into their own hands.
We await the results of this work with great interest.

I would like Baroness Ashton to tell me where she can offer consular assistance, as this is not always offered.
The frightening fact is that this technology exposes them to noise pollution at levels 200 billion times greater than that which we know already disturbs them, and so it is not really surprising that we are already seeing deaths from lung haemorrhages, from hearing loss and disruption of feeding, breeding and communication.
It is only after this that we review the Schengen system and look at how it can be adjusted or improved, because we can see that there are indeed problems with it, but let us stick to this order of things.
Left and right is only one dimension in politics.
Moreover, these issues of discrimination against women, children, homosexuals and migrants, and the continued existence of modern slavery, still affect a number of countries which pursue a policy of repression and refuse to allow themselves to be put in the dock.

The Commission has set out its views and presented a study which, if its recommendations were implemented, would result in a harmonisation of funding for individual Member States.
This is something that the groups’ spokesmen on environmental and climate issues should have nipped in the bud.
Last but not least, I would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone who assisted me in my work: the Information Society and Media Directorate General of the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism; I thank my fellow members of this House and those who are unable to be here today for their comments and proposals for amendments, and I thank the professional organisations for all their useful advice, invitations and explanations.
This is my maiden speech and I felt that I should be ill at ease with the meaning behind that thought.
It was in fact raised by the Austrian Foreign Minister during the informal meeting of foreign ministers. It was raised the day before yesterday by the Austrian Foreign Minister in Luxembourg and Doctor Wolfgang Schüssel will very probably take the opportunity afforded by his presence in Santa Maria da Feira to raise this issue.
Our limitations have recently made themselves painfully clear when dealing with conflicts of interest between Member States in the context of the northern gas pipeline project.

(ET) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although this is a shared sea, we have given it different names, and we must admit that we have not as yet come to see it as a shared space, or used all of its possibilities.
The time has come to check whether these laws and principles have also been translated into practice.
The result of that was that DG Press said that none of it was in order.
The Community's external links are currently divided between no less than six different services.
We have, rightly, embarked on a procedure for codifying such legislation - putting it in a single, readable, manageable text.
Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, including access to documents, remains essential in line with the negotiating framework.
In addition, I would point out that this is not a case of the EU lining up against the Philippines.
Is Mr Martinez aware, and are you Commissioner aware, of the fact that the AFSSA, the French food safety agency, has an annual budget of EUR 52 million and has a board of governors of whom 50% are appointed by the French government, the other 50% representing farmers, food retailers and food distributors?
We are going to continue to support energy saving, energy efficiency and renewable energies, and we are also spearheading the development of a methodology - an inevitably complex one, given the technical difficulties - to evaluate more precisely the carbon footprint of all the projects that we finance.
I believe that we must work to bring the positions of all the Member States closer together in this field, since, amongst other things, we are now, at the very least, an area of free movement of persons, goods etc.
I feel that we need to try to distribute the available funds so as to create more support than discontent, and I feel that this is very important for the image of culture at the European level.

It does not refer to the recognition of the Palestinian government or to the release of thousands of Lebanese and Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons.
I welcome what the report contains about providing contact points in all Member States to inform patients of the medical treatments available, how to apply for cross-border healthcare, and how to lodge a complaint or appeal.
But if the American Congress judges that this is inappropriate, would this then be illegal?
When we look back at the very short period during which we have worked on employment policy within the EU, we have to note that it has been relatively successful.
However, I am even sorrier about the numerous statements she made during the latter part of the campaign, which disputed the judgment of the International Court of Justice relating to the Black Sea continental shelf.
Greater freedom in defining countries' priorities will offer genuine opportunities for agricultural regions to develop.
Every single time, the reports are based on the idea that the European Parliament is perfect in its proficiency and therefore can and should charge the Commission and the Member States with the task of complying with its instructions.

The Commission has now presented an evaluation of its implementation and given an account of outstanding issues and future challenges.
Although the EU is by far the largest donor, it comes off far worse in terms of people' s perceptions than do the large multilateral organisations, such as the UN and the World Bank.
We stick to our original position because a non-response from a country cannot be considered as an indication that a prohibition is sought any more than it could be considered that a consent is given.
Parliament could conduct itself ad absurdum in this way.
The transposition of this, in a consistent and full way, is absolutely vital for its effective operation.
The procedure is acceptable since it consists of a package of measures rather than isolated proposals.

In our resolution, we are right to focus on the shortage of health workers, often caused by brain drain, a phenomenon whereby highly trained doctors and nurses decide to work elsewhere in the world.
Such behaviour only underlines the fact that it is only with independence - the normal status of independence - that Scotland can properly contribute to the international community, and I hope that the European Council will very soon be discussing internal enlargement of the European Union, with Scotland leading the way.
Affordability must in each case take the groups and regions with the lowest incomes as the point of reference.
The problem, Mr President, is obviously the question of how these European parties should be connected.
B5-0614/2000 by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, on behalf of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on Iraq;
- (LT) Commissioner, if a wealthy and economically stable nation such as Sweden is unable to introduce the euro, I cannot but question the future of the euro zone project.
I scarcely regard that as acceptable, and that is why I repeat that I wish to avoid the reconciliation procedure, but not at any cost!
Madam President, I refuse to accept that there must inevitably be a technology gap between generations, between social strata, between those who are 'switched on' and those who are not, between those whose life and work will derive maximum benefit from digital technology and those for whom such technology will remain an object of fear and a threat to their place in society.
That is rather fragile.
Additional expenses which the new rules entail, if they put the operation of certain airports at risk, should be reimbursed, whereby, however, the principle applies that in the medium term, the costs must be borne by the users and the sector.
That does not mean, however, that we can turn a blind eye to human rights abuses.
Its scope cannot be reduced to a simple market-harmonisation or competitiveness problem.

We are interested in having sound foundations so that we do not just lurch from one problem to the next, but so that we can work together on a solid basis for years to come, because the problem in the Balkans is not a problem which can be solved in a year.
Greater stability means more controls, it means intervening promptly and effectively, and it means making the most of competitiveness.
The Fifth Report on Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion takes excellent account of these factors, and it is also very important that we invest more time and money in success.

In the medium term, I am also in favour of the Commission proposal to create a special assistance fund for natural, technological and environmental disasters with a value of no less than EUR one billion.
I suggest to the House that the Commission keep itself fully informed of developments relating to the inquiry and that it keeps the Committee on Fisheries fully informed.
It would certainly be wrong simply to throw a European solution over them and accommodate everything under it.

insisted on increasing the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund;
A lot of the interventions focused on taking a very serious view of and putting a very high priority on the provisions of public health which were set out both in the Maastricht and in the Amsterdam Treaties, and I would like to think that perhaps in the next framework we could take a rather wide interpretation of what is involved in the Amsterdam Treaty in preparing our new framework.
The situation is extremely delicate and sensitive: the country is experiencing a general crisis - economic, financial, social, political and even military. That is why we placed Guinea-Bissau on this week's agenda.
But I do believe that the Commission communication is a start, and we should try to take full advantage of all possibilities within the European Union.
It also serves, however, as a reminder to the international community of the need for reform in China.
I think we should speak openly about both of these forms of totalitarianism.

The area of freedom, security and justice must be backed up by a solid guarantee of the respect for rights corresponding to the realities of contemporary society, which is in line with the open and innovative approach which this Parliament wishes to see.
This is clearly a situation in which people who are defending the universal declaration of human rights are being denied the right they are guaranteed under that declaration to leave and to return to their own country.
Now let us turn to the future for a moment.
This, I believe, is discrimination against one Member State and one language.
I should like to know what has happened to the thinking behind the rational planning in the gas and electricity distribution sectors draft directive.
We would have a common target for investment here: gas, which we badly need and whose new production and satellite regions in the north are quite near us.
How can it be that Parliament is not asserting its representative role so as to demand that its initiatives be endorsed as a matter of course by the Commission?

That is the acid test.
The business lunch or dinner is valuable when it comes to fostering contacts and building up client confidence - especially for small companies, who can also use the occasion to present their products.
Let us move on to actions.
(FR) Mr President, at the time of the legislative elections in 2006, I asked a Palestinian: 'Do you think that these elections will bring peace?'
Thus, the tensions will increase, and we require new legislative and financial instruments and a powerful EU strategy for us to succeed in managing oil in a fair and sustainable way.

This was very clear in Mr Winkler's speech.

Thirdly, macro-financial assistance shall be supplementary to the resources provided by the IMF and other multilateral institutions.
In order to retain its leadership, Europe will have to demonstrate an innovative approach to the climate issue and offer something other than the sole target of a global reduction in emissions via the highly speculative system of a market for greenhouse gas emissions, a tool that the US Government has, moreover, just rejected.
The intention was to cover an amount of EUR 342 million, potentially subject to the n+2 rule.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the opportunity which the Eurodac System will afford us in terms of fighting the current abuse of the asylum application system, for a great number of reasons, must be welcomed.
Once more, my thanks for this, and my thanks once more to every one of you.
He was critical of the judgement of the German Federal Constitutional Court of October 1993 concerning the draft Maastricht Treaty: the author did not share the basis of his assertion that the passing of power to the European Community would potentially constitute a deprivation of the democratic principle.
It is true that this is also not the way to dialogue, although they are not aimed towards Russia.
This is explained by the fact that, following the collapse of the Soviet regime, he has replaced a succession of ephemeral governments which had exasperated the Belorusian population by, firstly, privatising everything left, right and centre, including even essential public services which thereupon came under the control of Western firms and, secondly and above all, by attempting to detach Belarus from Russia, something to which the Belorusian people could not consent.
My group does not accept the compromise that the Presidency and the rapporteur laboriously arrived at, not because we are opposed to a European return policy but because we feel that the result is very inadequate as regards protecting fundamental rights.
I think even a climate sceptic like Mr Wilson should take care of citizens and support energy efficiency and efforts to decrease the energy bill.
However, although I acknowledge that the report outlines the difference in treatment to be afforded to high-sea fisheries and smaller-scale fisheries, it is lamentable that any more expense be imposed upon the latter particularly.
It turned out to be beneficial for the new Member States, but I warn you that the social unrest it may cause may mean that we will go from bad to worse, and the directive would not only lead to social unrest, it would also undo the good work.
. (PT) It is our view that policies for protecting the environment and natural resources are crucial to sustainable development.
Industry cannot guarantee that we shall have alternatives available by 2010 which will meet the specific and extremely demanding safety standards for aircraft tyres.

We wish to avoid completely the situation whereby these regulations end up having less of an impact in terms of simplification as compared to the Commission's initial proposal.
The third issue is how different countries receive asylum seekers and which countries are chosen.
They will not fall as a result of the adoption of these two paragraphs.
For my part, I am convinced that, in the present situation, the best way is that of continued work by the weapons inspectors, quite simply because military intervention is always the last resort.
(NL) Mr President, the new Treaty of Lisbon has made energy the shared responsibility of the EU and the Member States.
However, we must insist that political and religious prisoners are released.
It surely cannot be right, when everyone believes that Europe's purpose in this market organisation, in everything we do in the banana business, is to protect the small and independent growers against the large multinationals, if we table an amendment to precisely that effect, specifying that support payments are to be made to small and independent growers and not to multinational concerns, and if this amendment is then rejected.
The recommendations in the motion for a resolution and the specific proposals for certain changes or addenda to the Commission proposal will, we hope, help to formulate a position which is also politically acceptable to the Council for the preparation of a reliable budget for the period 2007-2013.
The proposal therefore singles out the measures which should be given top priority for adoption at EU level in order to solve some of the outstanding problems.
Her report makes provision for this and I support it.
The Court does not define 'non-significant' .

The Spanish Government and the Mauritanian Government have begun to cooperate, but I hope that the European Union, and specifically the Commission and the Council, will adopt measures to help resolve this great human tragedy very soon.
This Commission communication highlights new challenges in relation to Internet usage: broadband is needed to stimulate new services; schools are connected but the Internet is not yet sufficiently part of the pedagogical process; governments online have to move towards full electronic transactions.
The report of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy boosts these intentions as far as the centralisation of energy policy and the strengthening of the EU's powers in the field are concerned.
Mr President, this is something which cannot wait.
I must say that I support the criticism of the Commissioner&#x02BC;s supervision of the fifth programme of measures of the environment.
Some people in Britain were worried some years ago by the level of immigration from the Indian sub-continent.
It does not prevent a single Member State from making better regulations.
In fact, this proposal for a recommendation is a consequence of the rejection of the Danish and Greek initiatives and is the corollary to the purely imaginary exercise and the game of make-believe that both rapporteurs have been peddling.
The international community needs to address how to frame a UN Security Council resolution or resolutions on Iraq.
The networks are in daily contact and allow for the timely exchange of information, laying the ground for rapid action.
Will she now add this to her list and give us an undertaking that she will fight to try and ensure that this partnership agreement is suspended?
Having said that, although our debates are programmed into the agenda, it is impossible to predict exactly how long they will last, give or take a few minutes or a quarter of an hour, not least because the Commissioners and the ministers sometimes take up much more speaking time than the sitting staff plan for.
The conclusion of the summit should see an affirmation of objectives, namely the promotion of stability, well being and solidarity in the region, the presentation of an agenda for coordinated action for a stable, participative democracy, for economic cooperation, for integration and development and last but certainly not least for cooperation on environmental protection.
It is commonly known that the army is largely responsible for crimes and serious violation of human rights.
I very much hope that a diplomatic solution can be found here.
Within the Italian national anthem is the line ‘’, which – I will say it for the benefit of the interpreters – means ‘let us all join together for the coming battles’.
Because when you made your proposals back in January, and we studied them carefully, it was clear that the Commission' s appointment policy - and that is how we put it then - is a matter for the Commission and we should not interfere with it, unless there is obvious cause for this.
We have seen this strategy succeed in former dictatorships in Southern Europe, we shall see it work in Eastern and Central Europe, and it ought also to work in Turkey.
I referred to these in my previous reply.
The debate is closed.
This health check is not a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy.
I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets Chairman Mr Böge, the shadow rapporteurs and coordinators of the political groups, my colleagues and the advisors and employees of the Budget Committee who took part in most of the discussions.
The European farming sector is of socio-economic importance, particularly in terms of ensuring the security of food supply and in terms of promoting rural communities and the environment.
Perhaps, as I said before, we should deal with the definition before the procedure.
I am not talking about being tired of having to deal with this subject, but about being tired at the lack of results, despite constant pressure from this Parliament.
The Commission’s first response was confined to EUR 30 million, which Commissioner Barnier himself recognised as falling well short of expectations and requirements.
The Commission will, of course, invite Member States and international authorities to share information on their findings and approaches and to discuss any proposed follow-up actions resulting from the opinion provided by the independent scientific experts.
I am delighted that Poland was one of the countries that put forward this initiative.
The Global Approach to Migration, which was adopted by the European Council in December 2005, still forms the basic framework for defining the response to these challenges.
Mr President, it is a case of better late than never as far as the Commission is concerned!
If my report has given rise to some differences of opinion, they are never about the objective, only about what we consider to be the most appropriate means of achieving that objective.
From the beginning, the Commission has supported the idea of shared management.
Could I suggest further to Mrs Green that she takes another look at the figures because the figures I saw this morning showed that Mr Blair lost by 13 votes.
Madam President, allow me to start by using a military analogy in these times of war.
Such reallocation is best dealt with in the context of the issuing and renewal of licences.
We also believe that the economic and social governance of the Union should be turned into a reality, which means that the progress made in the first part of the Constitution should be reflected in the third part, dedicated to the Union’s policies, and furthermore that the legal basis for the protection and development of public services must be maintained, and then it will be able to be enshrined in a framework law.
The reason is that we have to explain this policy to our citizens who are full of concern: they should not be afraid of immigration as such, but of those who commit crimes.
We believe that was the correct thing to do, but that the Commission should have simultaneously taken action against the Member State in question and required it to comply with the relevant standards.
I call on the Commission to use the review to examine whether or not and how the introduction of a single passport per person has contributed to a decrease in the number of child abductions.
The EU has a duty towards the citizens of its Member States, and as a member of the international community, to play a unique role in its immediate sphere of influence.
We also have soils which have been taken out of agricultural production.
   . – Mr President, it is a striking coincidence that this afternoon should find us discussing air and maritime safety.
We now need to understand what is realistic and feasible at this stage.
We cannot pretend that the European Constitution was not rejected by the French and the Dutch.
Protection against specified zoonoses
Let us not fear expanding the Union as a result of the accession of the next few states.
If the current rate of growth is maintained, the improvements needed to compensate for the anticipated environmental impact of the increase in air traffic will not be made.
It is salutary to recall that over 60 000 people have been killed during the course of this conflict - people in both ethnic groups.

The Commission welcomes the Government's intention to allow the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees access to the boat people.

(Applause)
It is an operation begun immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet Union.
Secondly, let us consider home-grown players.
Let me now briefly list and address a few of the major development problems that occur in all the target regions, meaning all the German target regions.
There is a risk of contradictions between establishing the very long-term basis of those kinds of deals and the liberalisation of the gas market inside the Union, to which we would give priority.

Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged 35 to 55.
We know that online shopping is a contemporary phenomenon, but that the laws that govern it are behind the times, and now it is time to move on.
It is extremely important that the entry into force of this directive should not be retroactive and, consequently, that no provision derived from this act can be applied to drivers already working in the profession.
Europe, which is not only a trading bloc, but also one of values and standards, is an area that could make a huge impact on that level.
I also agree with the rapporteur that it would be necessary, on this as on other aspects of environmental policy, since there are regulations, directives and decisions, to simplify and consolidate the legislation.
The European Parliament has a reputation to maintain when it comes to the protection of civil rights, particularly in recent years.
From a dialectical point of view, they have presented us with a very simple problem, or so it would seem.
This systematic approach was applied across all services and the information provided was then carefully screened for extra certainty.
This means that there must be recognition of the need to implement an effective Action Plan in order to ensure appropriate linkages between the approaches and initiatives of the different Member States and the EU regarding the prevention of, detection of, preparation for and response to CBRN incidents.
As it is the Member States which in the final analysis will implement the proposed freezing of suspected terrorists' financial assets and as this must in any case be carried out through measures within each Member State, there is nothing to suggest that an EU regulation is required or that it will speed up the implementation of necessary measures.
All this is highly surprising.
There was no crisis mechanism, either temporary or stable, and there were no strong institutions to provide financial supervision.
We have looked at this in detail in the Constitutional Committee, and the committee's opinions were fairly evenly divided.
We must act, as I have said, to implement bans within the Member States to ensure that the most contaminating products are transported in more secure vessels, to guarantee that these are monitored to the highest possible degree; but we also need to act immediately, while knowing that this will only bear fruit in the medium term, at international level, to promote change in international maritime law.
I firmly believe that the veterinary authorities, the Member States and the Commission have been working together very closely and effectively.
Mr König, we have made far less progress in this area than you seemed to suggest.
It not just aircraft noise, which has very rightly been highlighted, and noise from factories that we are talking about.

Clear strategies and plans need to be in place now if they are to have any effect.
Mr President, Mr Bösch's report on the independence of UCLAF has been taken off the agenda.
This policy has been pursued by the Italian Government, with varying degrees of success, but it now appears that this approach is coming in for criticism from the Commission.
There were two reasons for that.
However, the dynamic provided by the efforts of Martti Ahtisaari in determining the status of Kosovo is helping us to inject more hope as well as the spirit and methods of the European Union into the lives of all the inhabitants of this region.
Of course, both good and bad things might be said about such negotiations, but the fact is that there is no question of objectivity.
This is also key for close cooperation between the different directorates in the Commission and DG External Relations.
Another saying we have at home is 'at least no one died', but this is no longer true: people are dying.
All in all, the Commission left a great deal to be desired in its handling of the BSE crisis, and committed serious errors and omissions.
To those, on one side or the other, furthermore, who would have us choose between growth and justice, we would answer that we refuse to choose between growth and justice, or justice and growth.
Subsidiarity is about having scope to take your own decisions on a local basis, so that things may perhaps be different in Bavaria - where I come from - from what they are in, say, Luxembourg, where the Commissioner comes from, or in Spain, Portugal, Greece or, in future perhaps, in Lithuania.
It undermines the foundations of the EU and, moreover, it is always the smaller countries who have to suffer, as this case has proven once again.
This heightened awareness is also needed if the directive is to be transposed. Transposition is currently incomplete.
I would just like to draw attention to two specific features of the SAVE II programme which are truly worth bearing in mind.
At the same time, I am following with great attention the repeated efforts of the Commission and certain other parties, for whom the proposed target seems, on the contrary, rather unambitious, to reopen the debate on this topic and to try and change this regulation in order to set more stringent targets.
You mentioned it yourself and it is cautious and to my mind, quite inadequate.
And, furthermore, you say this as a representative of a political party which is illegal in Spain, which defends terrorists and kills those of us who defend our ideas.
I would also like to thank Parliament for its dedication and cooperation, which have given great impetus to the European Union's policy on immigration and asylum during the almost five months of the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the Union.
The tax dispute has already been touched on.
I ask: Why should not it?
The right to health is after all considered to be a fundamental right in all the EU Member States, and one that is conferred on the basis of solidarity.
Well done again to Mr Coelho on his report.
The next item is the report (A4-0260/98) by Mrs van Dijk, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, on the report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the state of women's health in the European Community (COM(97)0224 - C4-0333/97).
If things go well, we will end up with ever-decreasing quantities of waste.
Overall, I support the proposal, even if I have one fundamental criticism of it.
The substances that have been allowed into food must be approved, and active packaging must not be misleading to consumers.
As regards the proposed Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, we realise that life for people with disabilities would be very positively affected were the Commission's proposal to become a reality.
On the contrary, political actions also have to be undertaken, beginning with a programme of initiatives designed to manage the flow of growing economic emigration towards, inevitably, our own countries that sometimes constitutes an undeniable advantage for the European economy.
Subject: Arrest of the leader of the Chilean Communist Party for insulting General Pinochet
All the conditions seem to me to be in place - I say that in all conscience, but I may be wrong - for me to propose the inclusion of this item on the agenda under Rule 111.
It was said to be a measure to promote tourism.
Also, perhaps, some thought should be given to the relationship with national parliaments.
Can you guarantee that the Commission will not use qualified majority voting on any of those issues?
I would also like to highlight the part concerning fair competition with third countries, because in the past, we have been too permissive in this area, and entire basic sectors, such as the Tuscan textile sector, for instance - and I am quite sure of this because I am from Prato - have been brought to their knees by unfair competition that should certainly have been stopped and prevented at source.
Schools, and especially girls' schools, are being burnt down or forced to close, bridges and roads are being blown up.
Finally, energy efficiency will not create high quality jobs unless it is based on a genuine EU strategic industrial initiative which is free of the constraints of the free market.
At the General Affairs Council of 24 February 1997, a number of Member States sought to involve the Turkish Cypriots in the negotiations on the accession of Cyprus to the EU, thus placing the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot 'State' established in the northern part of the island following the Turkish military invasion in 1974 on an equal footing, contrary to the conclusions of the UN and the EU, according to which there is but one legal and recognized government in Cyprus.
I wanted to ask if you currently have more detailed and more specific information available on the question of the guidelines which the European Commission will issue as regards public and private investment within the framework of Barcelona II, because the water sector is a very important sector for the quality of life and equal development which we want to achieve in the Mediterranean basin.
There are tens of thousands of sports clubs, numerous associations and federations; there are sports movements, and the entire sporting community is essentially one of the great popular movements within the European Union.
Zoning of our rather urbanised regions is to be possible, thus improving practicability without compromising our ultimate objectives.
About 7 million overseas tourists visit Ireland every year.
Enlargement of the European Union in all its stages meant it acquired new neighbours.
While welcoming the Commission communication on Innovation Union as a flagship initiative of the EU 2020 strategy for growth and jobs, I think there are still priority areas where we need a greater commitment to building capacities in science, technology and innovation: efficient resource use, recovery and recycling of waste, food quality and safety, and new epidemics.
There is no logic to this whatsoever!
It involves giving priority to diplomatic and preventive action, supporting governments as they fulfil their obligation to protect their own people, and applying appropriate pressure where necessary. The latter could include diplomatic and economic sanctions.
in writing. - (FI) The European Union is full of big words. Once again this morning they have been used to speak about the Lisbon Strategy.
Of course, my group' s vote will depend on the outcome of the vote on the committee' s amendments and also on the amendments that will be proposed tomorrow.
In the new Treaty, however, things are set to change, in that Parliament is given formal consultation rights and the right to adequate information.
In my report I call for a comprehensive scheme of incentives and training for fishermen in the use of conservation technology to be included in any package of measures as a matter of urgency.
I agree that 2009 will be a watershed year for the functioning of the European institutions. I am optimistic, however, that this fact will not get in the way of implementing key objectives for the year.
This House has repeatedly and clearly opposed this and called for an external chamber for budgetary discipline to be established at the European Court of Auditors or Court of Justice, which should be called in whenever the financial accountability of officials is at issue.
Looking at the global aspect of this challenge, the first and most important point of criticism is the pathetic level of official development assistance, which is now 0.24%, far from the 0.7% that was promised.
We are proposing to cooperate with the Dublin Institute and to take account of all the other resources (the resources of the Commission and other European institutions such as EUROSTAT and the European Employment Observatory, the evaluations and other studies we have); all these will be taken into account and this mechanism will support the social dialogue between partners, employers and the public and will support policy makers in managing this change.
Only firm and massive condemnation by world opinion, unconditional and without digression, only co-ordinated organization of all civilised countries and peoples in the fight against terrorism, will make erosion of it, if not eradication, possible.

It would not be in the interests of either the existing Member States or of the candidate countries to fix the date for accession to the EU now.
I hope it will receive your support tomorrow in the vote.
(PL) Mr President, Poland would like any decision on replacing our national currency with the euro to be taken on the basis of a referendum, as was the case in Sweden.
Issues of taxation, retail monopolies, advertising, import restrictions and age limits should all be decided by the individual Member States.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is our success.
There is a very large landfill site in Spain, for example, and this will not be closed until it is completely full, which will not be for some decades.
The latest assessments are very clear, in all areas from police and judicial cooperation to data protection and policies on visas and air, sea and land border controls.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members, many thanks for your very pertinent questions.
   Mr President, I should like to express my emphatic agreement with the broad thrust of what was said by the previous speaker but one, Mr Wohlin.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a Commission report on efficiency and accountability in European standardisation under the new approach.
We shall investigate and check the matter, and you will be told at the next part-session what the explanation is.
The 10th European Development Fund is also extremely important in terms of its financial commitment and, in terms of scope, it is 64% larger than its predecessor, the 9th European Development Fund.
We condemn any interference in the decisions of the judiciary in a Member State governed by the rule of law.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution that I have tabled is in response to some tragic events which have recently taken place in Egypt and in other countries of the world - just yesterday in Nigeria - and is intended to bring to this House's attention an increasingly serious and intolerable situation whereby members of the Christian community are being persecuted and killed.
And there is something in this mandate which is deeply repellant to anyone who knows the law, because it cannot be measured, be examined, in terms of employment and competitiveness, important as they both are.
We will approach the budgetary authority in order to get the green light for accessing and using funds from the emergency budget reserve, as in earlier years when ECHO's normal budget did not cover the needs that arose because of terrible events.
Rather it means that it sometimes takes a while for projects to be clearly defined, funds to be allocated and payments to be made.
Mr President, own-initiative reports are usually just hot air, but if adopted they are an expression of the political will of the European Parliament.
It is fair to say that this progress is largely due to the reforms inspired by the relaunched Lisbon Agenda for Growth and Employment.
Those who are any good at mental arithmetic will have figured out that some 24% of the overall budget is left over, and this is in order to give the Commission flexibility and to make it possible for more to be set aside for Youth Week in one year and to do more for voluntary service or direct youth exchange in another.
The rest are queuing.
That is the reason we support this; it is not the only reason but a major reason.
I want to raise too the whole question of the need for agreement on taxation.
An important observation in the document is that atheistic extremism may undermine people's ability to co-exist peacefully.
It is certainly not wanted by the British people, nor, I believe, is it wanted by many of the citizens in the rest of Europe.
I should like, finally, to say how very pleased I was with Mr Romeva’s report.
Mr President, the Council proposals liberalizing airport groundhandling services could actually have very serious consequences for jobs and safety at the airport in my own constituency, Dublin, and indeed at other major airports throughout Europe, as has been mentioned by other speakers.
So the conference in Singapore was certainly a success as regards the further opening-up of markets and making further progress towards deregulation.
It is excellent that Eurostat's powers are to be increased.
   . – Mr President, our thanks must go, in the first place, to Mr Hutchinson for this important report.
As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I wished, among other things, to highlight the following issues: firstly, the increase in annual cancer-related deaths caused by exposure to carcinogens in the workplace, but also the importance of better access to information on medication for cancer patients; the implementation of the REACH Regulation and the regular updating of the list of substances of very high concern, which covers carcinogens; the support for initiatives seeking to prevent imports of goods containing cancer-producing chemicals and to intensify checks to detect such chemicals within the European Union; and, lastly, the drafting of guidelines for a common definition of disability covering persons suffering from chronic diseases or from cancer.
It also has the potential to boost Internet and distance sales businesses because shoppers will have greater confidence in services based in the EU.
To some politicians, however, and sadly also some fellow MEPs, that means that we have to do business first and foremost, and that we should just mention human rights, but on no account focus attention on them too much.
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, none of us wishes to cast doubt on the need to implement a directive that dates back to 1999, as the credibility of this institution is at stake, and none of us wishes to cast doubt on the need to protect the wellbeing and health of animals.
Finally, it is most important that there should be a direct and intense response from the public sector to all aspects of the report and the proposed actions, because in numerous states the public sector is also the provider of most of the environmental information.
That was, moreover, the tone of the speech made by my excellent fellow Member, Mr Busuttil, which I support.
I hope that the Finnish Presidency, whose statements I welcomed this morning, wishes to take the credit for having started the implementation of the promises enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
That means a patchwork of different safeguards and provisions for processing personal data.
The quantity of amendments is too great and too many of them are simply technical in nature.
And with regard to spending, ECU 39 107.8 m was divided among three main areas.
Some of us have been working to reach agreements, to bring positions closer together, in order to achieve what in the end has become a reality.
One reason I support the initiative is because there are some Members of this House who take the view that we should ultimately compel manufacturers to come and collect used toothbrushes from our bathrooms.
But different values must apply here, because there are two combustion components: on the one hand the combustion of oil or waste, and on the other hand that of ores.
We have declared 14 September 2001 a day of mourning in the 15 Member States.
The independence of central banks is certainly an important aspect of legal convergence.
The question is: what is the Commission going to do to ensure that this initiative is more than a mere flash in the pan?
We all know that that is out of the question, bearing in mind the economic and social consequences it would have for our sea fishermen and the whole fisheries industry.
While it is true that the control policy is one of the most resounding failures of the Common Fisheries Policy, it is also true that the Commission has maintained it since 1993 and has decided to modify it just as it presents a draft report on the reform of the CFP announcing a complete review of the conservation and management system.
In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to quote some words spoken yesterday in Madrid at the launching of Sami Nair's latest book, entitled: 'Mediterráneo hoy, entre el diálogo y el rechazo '.
The discussion on taxes will only result in delays in the Council, amongst other places.
But, as Kipling would say, that is another story.
It will be the Irish taxpayers who will pay the penalties!
Mr President, it is indeed a shame that Mr Farage is no longer with us.
Laudable as the proposed changes are, in many ways they are merely tinkering around the edges.
However, we oppose a method which seeks to subordinate employment and social rights in general to the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPG) and the stability plans.
This influx of refugees, or false refugees, poses Europe a problem of incoherence.
We are not talking about new items in this particular proposal but we will be doing it later on in the year, as I say.
The Fundamental Rights Agency will in turn be able to draft reports and opinions for the EU institutions and provide guidance and opinions.
The Council would like to remind everyone of the conclusions reached on 25 May 1994 in this matter, which concern nuclear safety in the electricity industry in Central and Eastern European countries and the newly independent states, and in which the Council defines its approach to this question.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
I am voting in favour of Mr Gualtieri's report.
These areas are characterised by a lower level of economic development, lower population densities, inadequate access to all kinds of public services and limited job opportunities outside agriculture.

Of course, compensation has to be paid, including to the holdings responsible for the crisis, if they are not to go under completely.
Is the Commission satisfied with the progress of the Peace and Reconciliation Programme for Northern Ireland?
This dreadful situation could continue indefinitely.
The bullfight is much nobler than hunting, where at the end of the day the animal dies without being able to defend itself.
Commissioner, Madam President, at Christmas, we in the European Parliament ought also to be generous of spirit, so I would ask all Groups, especially the European People's Party, to vote in favour of the amendments calling for increased use of autonomous energy sources, even if this is only to eliminate the justification claimed by the Spanish Industry Minister who is taking refuge in this directive in order to increase unemployment in many Spanish regions.
This has a lot to do with acceptance of one’s own responsibility, not only for the past, but also for a shared future.
It is appropriate that we allow third countries the time to adapt, but 1 January 2009 is surely long enough a delay for that purpose.
We have a wide range of legislation governing waste streams. Therefore, it is not clear why a complete industry, which is expected to produce significant waste streams, is being exempted.
And of course there was a massive loophole in the whole system, a loophole big enough to drive a Rolls Royce through, in that manufacturers could as an alternative pay a 200 euro fine for not complying with the directive.
Madam President, recent events in Kosovo and concerning the Commission meant that the agenda for the Berlin summit was not as originally planned.
I hope that the Finnish Presidency will make efforts to resolve the above issues.
Madam President, exaggerated claims have made it difficult to ascertain fact from fiction at different stages of this difficult debate.
In this area of freedom, security and justice which we hope to create, all three elements are important, and Tampere acts on all three of them.
Mrs Seillier proposed that we should leave it up to the women themselves to decide whether they devote themselves to their family and the home or to professional life.
A great deal of effort is still required to turn these into achievements.
There is a total ban on using the Kurdish language, as there is on any manifestation of Kurdish culture.
As far as our institution is concerned, then, there is no before and after 11 March 2011.
We believe that the issue of radiation protection is entirely relevant.
If we want to intervene in Libya, the only sensible option for this to happen is on the basis of a resolution of the Security Council and with the involvement of Arab states.
(Applause)
In any process, however, such as the one with which we are currently occupied, we must not forget to look forward.
Nonetheless, bearing in mind the very high level of sensitivity of European consumers, we believe that labelling could give European producers an advantage.
Parliament is now a mature institution and will soon be embarking on its fifth term.
Recommendations were also made for support from the international community in setting up a dialogue between government and opposition, collecting in weapons, preparing new elections, drafting a new constitution and tackling macro-economic problems.
(ET) Sometimes it is good to be first, and sometimes it is good to be last.
In addition, the rapporteur is right in pointing out that both the Commission and the Member States can each in their own way contribute to the development of cities: the Commission by monitoring the side effects general economic and regional policy have on cities, and Member States by drawing up development plans for their cities and urban areas.
The Member States of the EU are also members of the Council of the Europe and thus committed to compliance with their obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.
Before we start debating ways to spend next year’s money, I believe we should sort out the mess that has been left behind in previous years.
Furthermore, there is no attempt to prevent such situations: alcohol continues to be served in plentiful quantities and, on many flights, free of charge to passengers.
It was my request in the Agriculture Committee that we had a debate on this and I much appreciate your coming.
In the provisions forming the subject of the second revision, it is rightly requested that ad hoc provisions relating to climate change be included, that the provisions relating to renewable energy be reviewed, that the provisions relating to rural development and food safety be enhanced, and that greater efforts be made to curb illegal financial flows and tax havens.
Sadly, there is considerable experience of the latter in Aragon, the region I represent.
The people of Belarus have shown that they want a democratically elected parliament, and President Lukaschenko finally accepted the result and offered the parliament his personal cooperation and that of his government.
Unfortunately, a reading of the report on mutual evaluation confirms these fears.
Not only are the meetings prepared by the prefects - which says a lot about their independence vis à vis the government - their conclusions will actually be drafted by a group of ten experts freely chosen by the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister.
Anyone who does not understand that will pay the price through higher interest rates and an inflation-prone Euro-zone.
Today, while I would like to extend thanks to the Commission for having given us an undertaking that it will devise a certification procedure for interdisciplinary breast centres and for specialist nurses in the field, I have to tell the Commissioners that we really would be pleased if they were to put these guidelines on the web, which would not be an over-hasty thing to do in this era of modern communication, and that we have not given up the hope of their putting the existing guidelines on sale in something other than book form alone.
In his speech to the United Nations general assembly, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that human rights activists are our eyes and ears and that they represent our collective conscience.
So I am delighted that Parliament, the Council and the Commission were able, almost as soon as the financial framework was finalised earlier this year, to reach agreement on the text of the programme decision.
Yesterday's meeting agreed in principle that a mission was a good idea, with almost everyone emphasising the importance of involving North Korea in the whole procedure at the highest possible level, including ?im Jong-il personally.
Up to now this project has had its own budget heading, which has allowed Parliament to monitor the situation and be kept regularly informed.
Is the European Commission prepared to promise that it will take account of the matters referred to in the amendments in the implementation phase of the directive?
in writing. - (HU) The latest German food safety scandal has directed our attention to the deficiencies of adequate regulatory supervision once again.
in writing. - (FR) Since the euro was introduced seven years ago, the purchasing power of the people of Europe has fallen considerably.
And just two other things: I am surprised that there appear to be no policy initiatives at all in the area of the knowledge society and information technology, despite the fact that there is a large and important work programme in progress.
We need to say very clearly: the door to Europe is open for Ukraine.
Mr Barroso is a rampant free marketeer, according to the people over there, while his ideas went out with the Ark according to Mr Mandelson, from the right.
Mr President, in the financial year 2008, payments to the tune of around EUR 5 billion were made in areas of policy that the Committee on Foreign Affairs is responsible for.
The proposed Directive aims to update EU measures based on lessons learned from recent epidemic scares and new scientific knowledge on how the disease spreads and risks to human health.
I would therefore like to salute the efforts undertaken under the Luxembourg and UK Presidencies this year in orchestrating very effective campaigns under these guidelines.
They face a double risk in the event of insolvency, namely that they could lose both their job and the value of their shares.
To conclude, Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Malmström and the entire Commission for precisely that: for assuring the Italian Government of its commitment - repeated again today - to tackle the humanitarian crisis in Lampedusa.
However, there is no reason to welcome the figure of 13 million unemployed that the text gives, which is certainly underestimated and which, moreover, fails to take into account those who have to settle for precarious and badly paid employment.
It is therefore very important that you keep your eyes open here.
The group of advisers can give advice, and it can even give advice about problems, but the decision has to be made by the legislator, and if the Commission does not base its proposals on that fact, then there will be friction.
With this information, and taking into account the latest scientific developments with respect to toxicological concern and consumer exposure, it will, if appropriate, propose amendments to Annex III, part B.
It is important for the Commission to have ongoing responsibility and for Parliament to have the role of supervisory power and not be governed by the agencies.
Normally, poverty and a lack of governability go hand in hand, and this was and is the case in Haiti, which means that, as well as supporting the reconstruction process, we need to support governability in Haiti, because it is the only way that we will be able to achieve the objective that we set ourselves in New York: that Haiti itself should lead its reconstruction and that its civil society should participate in this.
So while I broadly accept what is a good report, I think we must be careful, as we make progress on standards in Europe, that we also have the same standards for imports.
It is most encouraging that an increasing number of developing countries have already given priority to the interests of their population, but there is still a long way to go.
I hope that such a positive stance will be maintained by the House and by the administration which serves the House.
I condemn all violence, but especially that used against those in a more vulnerable position - physically, socially, economically or emotionally - such as children and also women.
My information from the services is that, Mr Martin, you would have been correct yesterday morning to point out that Amendment No 24 was not available in all language versions.
The crucial question is: who should foot the bill for environmental damage?
In the Stockholm Programme, we have prioritised police cooperation and the need to be able to manage this at Community level, in conformity with the Treaty of Lisbon.
The need now is to ensure that it can transmit twenty-four hours a day.
The move towards sector-wide programmes will greatly facilitate this process.
Mr President, Minister and President-in-Office, Commissioner, we really need you to explain these various aspects to us. Thank you very much.
And are we going to impose similar restrictions when a copyright is infringed in other ways?
Please ensure that our bid for codecision-making powers in the Committee on Fisheries is endorsed.
We support the Swoboda report and the sensible amendments tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
Mr President, the Convention method as a method of implementing treaty changes is something quite new.
Migration has become a burning issue for many Member States. But control measures and readmission agreements must never be the only answer to the challenges that arise from increased migration.
Let us put our money where our mouth is, look at FP7 and invest in this area.
I have heard the divided opinions of British colleagues.
Could we perhaps waste a little time?
It should be borne in mind, however, that eventually agreement will need to be reached with the Council concerning deadlines and authorised applicants. Nonetheless, I am confident of a positive outcome.
It is important that relations between Montenegro and Serbia evolve without Serbia attempting to interfere with its neighbour's development through ethnic Serbian parties.
It is true that ENTSOG, the new body, may develop a lot of technical codes, but it is also true that the Agency, based on the national regulators' initiatives and on their experience, could develop very important principles for the development of these codes, and together with the Commission ensure that this market is regulated by rules that will be applied by all.
All the members of the Council are usually pretty dozy.
I want the word deleted there as well.
Admittedly, the number of sectoral Councils may be too high, but it is primarily the lack of coordination between these sectoral Councils, which means that, unlike the European Parliament, in which the Assembly takes the final decision, the Council arm of the legislator has much more difficulty in coordinating its various decisions.
They will then have to be discussed by Parliament and by the Council so that agreement can be reached on the objectives and priorities for the Union during the first half of 2005.
rapporteur. - Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the President-in-Office for her encouraging words made in Bremen - and I hope also here during our debate today - as well as for her continued commitment in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
So, in order to combat both, we must create this area of freedom, security and justice with a shared objective: to defeat them, arresting and bringing to justice the instigators and authors of these crimes and by matching our tactics, and also our strategy, to the size, the context and the structure of each terrorist organisation.
Thank you, Mr Marín.
Delays are becoming the norm, including in the case of TGV services.
In Lisbon it was therefore possible to reach agreement on the following issues, enabling us to finalise the agreement on the Treaty:
Firstly, we must consider the fact that many Member States are currently under extreme pressure to cut staff and salaries.
I do expect it, however, to open doors to the future and to position the European Union on many issues.
For the Union to adopt legislation, we should not forget that it first needs a legal base in the Treaties - treaties which have been ratified by each and every national parliament.
   Mr President, I just wanted to protest at Commissioner Rehn’s absence from this important debate.
There are many very valuable elements in European culture, but instead of enjoying the aggregate of those elements we seem to achieve only an arithmetical average.
(FR) Mr President, I myself was not a friend of either Mr Ben Ali or Mr Mubarak.
We have not yet achieved equal pay for equal work, nor do we have more women in positions of leadership and more flexible child care.
This House strongly calls for the answer to be given before the new agreement is signed, because it is not acceptable that European farmers should continue to pay the price of this desire for free trade that is pervading Europe.
I believe that the rapporteurs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have done a good job in achieving a fine balance between the various requirements at issue, and I therefore think that Parliament should approve the proposals adopted in committee by a large majority.
The European Union has not yet learned to deliver and manage its external assistance programmes efficiently or to properly spend the resources that have been allocated to these purposes.
Through AIDS and malaria, Africa is losing the very generation it needs to build its future.
Bilateral trades, where the client gives the broker an order and he finds a match, have migrated from mainly verbal orders to predominantly electronic orders.
I also commend the report on European regional development by Mr Fava and I want to acknowledge Mr Fava´s willingness to listen to Committee colleagues and take on board a number of compromise amendments.
Now comes the difficult part, however.
Among the areas I am thinking about are refugees, organized crime, the drugs trade, the slave trade involving women and children, and fraud, corruption and effective police cooperation.
We must therefore work together to see that the democratic control over the WTO is as strict as that applied to the EU.
In the field of company law, the European Parliament welcomes the proposal by the Commission concerning the Parliament and Council Directive on the exercise of voting rights by shareholders of companies having their registered office in a Member State and whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market.
We should like to see the implementation of these rules and guidelines simultaneously applied with equal consequence and effectiveness in every aspect of Community action, from agricultural policy to agro-industrial policy to industrial activities, more generally, in particular where - in the less developed countries and regions of the European Union - it is responsible for a large share of highly harmful toxic emissions which could actually damage the future of human life.
We are, of course, trying to limit all bureaucratic and administrative procedures that create administrative burdens, particularly for SMEs, and we are committed to making life easier for SMEs.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I shall be brief as I have already used up my time slot.
It is also because the European institutional structure is fragmentary and in need of the integrating influence of a Constitution, which is why interim institutional agreements are required, along with a prudent and lasting organisational effort.
Amongst the new Member States, the report states, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia collect official data on racist violence and crime on a broader scale than other countries.
Thank you all.
The presence of Cypriot President Clerides, my colleague Mr Van den Broek and the Member States, through their Ministers of Foreign Affairs, at the opening of the 51st General Assembly of the United Nations will, I am certain, be an opportunity for all parties interested in finding a solution to the Cypriot problem to discuss the most recent events in Cyprus and try and re-launch the peace process.
When we want to promote European values in the neighbouring countries, of crucial importance are cultural and student exchanges and successful practical projects jointly realised.

The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
The contribution of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) to the guidelines for the 2012 budget was based on the concept of responsibility, which means pursuing the aims of economy, efficiency and effectiveness using as little as possible of the available resources.
Why do we not quote these prices in euros, as Mr Karlsson proposed in his report?
It is important that these efforts are redoubled in order to counter the rise in Islamophobia, Anti-Semitism and discrimination against other minority groups, especially those from new Member States.

The success of European integration means that the European political system is becoming more attractive to the people of countries beyond the Union.
We accept Amendments Nos 2, 5, 8, 10 and 15 in their entirety, and we accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11 and 12 in principle, but we will have to revise the terms in which they are incorporated.
There would be no more important contribution to world peace and the international fight against terrorism than if this conflict were to be resolved.
Madam President, I too would like to start by congratulating and thanking the rapporteur, Mr Grosch, for his work at first and second readings and for his willingness to listen to colleagues' suggestions, achieving a result which would appear to have won broad backing and which therefore has excellent chances of being adopted in tomorrow's vote in plenary.
The consumer would be the victim, with the possibility of excluding citizens from the Internet: a very serious matter.
Only a few weeks ago, Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission - and even though a President of the Commission may be a high official, he is, in the final analysis, only a purely politically elected official - told the Dutch people in their own country that they should now move on and accept this European Constitution, which, despite the rejection and democratic referendum in two Member States and despite the fact that quite a few other Member States do not even dare organise a referendum on this topic, is gradually being implemented anyway.
I told President Putin that people in the Member States were worried that the situation regarding freedom of speech and expression in Russia had taken a turn for the worse.

Clearly, this must change from 2006 onwards!
In her call for greater exposure and publicity for projects supported by the structural funds, Francisca Pleguezuelos Aguilar wants to give our citizens greater awareness of the benefits of cohesion policy.
It is in a similar spirit of compromise that I accept the rapporteur's offer, following the example of the Verts/ALE Group. In doing so, I hope that we can also come to an agreement on a message to Turkey whose dominant theme is not that the door is closed, but that we are waiting for real progress.
However, the excessively slow absorption of funds from the new programming period which we have observed in many Member States may threaten their effective utilisation.
This programme does not even take production into account.
   Mr President, Mr Eurlings is to be congratulated on his report, which is a product of careful, hard and objective work.
We are now turning for the first time directly to the citizens of Europe in our preparations for an Intergovernmental Conference.

See you soon!
The constraint of the 3% threshold for national budget deficits must be respected.
Mr President-in-Office, you and I agree on the goals of trying to inform the European public, not just in Brussels but everywhere, of what we are doing.

In my country, Hungary, at the peak of the suicide wave twenty years ago more than 45 out of every 100 000 people died by their own hand, a statistic with which we shocked the world.
In the absence of action by the Council, is it any wonder that we need an agency that will monitor, report and bring forward recommendations and thereby hold every single Member State to its international obligations?
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.
The social infrastructure must also be called upon: women' s organisations, trade unions, schools; we must involve these much more in the battle against life-threatening diseases.

As I know that colleagues in other groups had exactly the same problem with this word, I would suggest to friends and colleagues that it might be appropriate not to accept the compromise amendment but to vote instead in favour of both Amendments Nos 100 and 101, which are compatible, and that would achieve precisely the result desired by many people.

in writing. - (ES) I voted in favour of this report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the citizens' initiative because, although it only vaguely satisfies my group's position, because it ignores important issues such as the idea of allowing initiatives proposing changes to the Treaties or that of extending the period for collecting signatures from the proposed 12 months to 18 months, I believe nonetheless that the report is an considerable yet insufficient improvement on the text put forward by the Commission.

We have to look for and find a European solution.
(PT) Despite the fact that trains continue to offer a safe, environmentally-friendly means of transport, capable of carrying large volumes of goods and passengers comfortably and speedily, with a high quality of service, the truth of the matter is that an open, competitive railway system in the Community area is still a long way off.
At a time when the Fourth Cohesion Report is being prepared and the debate on the future of regional policy is starting in the run-up to the review of the financial perspective for 2008-2009, the European Parliament should remember that the European Union cannot deal differently with similar situations or with different situations in the same way.

Bearing in mind the fact that every initiative in the area of contract law will have to respond clearly to the actual needs and problems of businesses and consumers, I take the view that any justification in this area will have to be based on practical evidence relating to the current situation in contract law and any difficulties encountered by businesses and consumers, particularly in cross-border transactions.
Certainly, we can agree that the Commission proposal entails problems, difficult issues and delicate considerations.

We accordingly have a duty to give our support to a man, Professor Ibrahim, who has worked in the tradition of Ibn-Khaldoun, and we should make it clear - and this is also something that we owe, as it were, to the heritage of Ibn-Khaldoun - that there are not two concepts of human rights, one for Europe and one for Egypt, but that there is a single concept of human rights here, which is also appropriate in common cultural and historical terms and which should apply universally today.
Fortunately, President-in-Office, we women from the seven political parties have accurately described what we want in a letter: it's the flower, it's our flower for you, dear President.
In December, Council talked about the need for all Member States to return to the Stability Pact criteria by the end of 2013.

The United States of America is arguably at the forefront of the campaign tackling the problem of money laundering.

Greece's additional annual debt equates to less than one week of the United States' additional debt.
Full employment is and always will be one of the most important objectives of the Lisbon strategy, Barcelona confirmed that.
But to say all of a sudden, after the event, that this is where the fault lay is unworthy.
As you will certainly recall, at the Cologne Summit at the beginning of June, the next country to hold the Presidency, Finland, was charged with the task of preparing for the next Intergovernmental Conference.
In doing so, they are showing their determination to attack the main pillars of democracy.
For example, I believe there is a call for a European social security card in this report, which really should not be allowed through this House at this stage.
We have also adopted and annexed to our report the reasons for the decision of 17 December 1998.
I very much regret that the European Parliament was not in a position to act as a sort of flanking measure by passing a joint resolution, and I am very thankful that the Commissioner has taken this up today in his explanation.
In endorsing the Böge report, I call for support for the proposal for greater funds in the budget after 2013.
However, behind them stands a clear instruction: the European Parliament is calling on the other institutions, the Commission and the Council, to pay attention to scientific data whenever we pass decisions on fisheries issues and how we fish.

The report commissioned for the June conference warned that the international financial system has become a money launderer's dream, processing a large part of the estimated $200 billion worth of drugs money every year.
European public opinion is in favour of the restitution of the Parthenon Marbles.
I would like to remind the House that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water networks two years ago and I would be most obliged if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it has taken on that report.
Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising, first of all, the timing and the topicality of this debate on the devastating floods in Mozambique.

I know that, in relation to the elements I have just mentioned with regard to the pact, you may say to me that these instruments count in those countries with budgetary positions below 3% in terms of deficit.
The latest findings unfortunately show that the risk to road safety from such vehicles has risen exponentially, and it is obvious that these figures do not relate only to Germany.

As the author is not present, Question No 17 lapses.
I see the most important success at Doha as having been the formulation now contained in the Doha Declaration, which gives us the chance to decide for ourselves the direction we will take in agricultural policy.
But that is enormous too.
Indeed, what is unacceptable in a time of further globalisation, of social issues, is that we would be unable to find answers, because the division that was would simply carry on.
The observers concerned were quick to point out that this indignation was rather late in coming and that it could have been voiced when the Taliban took power because of the archaic and barbaric regime which they established in defiance of the most basic rights of the Afghan people.

The Liberal Group is against any European interference in family matters, and will therefore support only those paragraphs that are aimed at providing better protection for children.
However, many Member States claim that these quotas are unfair.
The Congolese Government must put its commitments to democratization and human rights into effect, and it must allow the United Nations to carry out the work for which it has been mandated.
I also want to mention a new feature of this programme: namely the introduction of the Risk Sharing Finance Facility designed for more risky RTD projects.
The report does nothing to change the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development-environmental guidelines nor does it eliminate the apparent aim for people or bodies not directly related so far with farming to benefit from this instrument.
We are very pleased to hear about the appointment of Ambassador Moratinos as the Union's special envoy, since we believe that the European Union should have an independent policy and role in the Middle East, in collaboration with but not subordinate to the United States.
I call on the Commission to submit measures for a European scrapping scheme as quickly as possible.
These actions and priorities all lead in the same direction: elimination of what liberals call the rigidities in the internal market, elimination of subsidies to certain sectors of industry, and correct application of international treaties.

Many of you will, I hope, take your places in the next European Parliament.
Those are concerns that we should all emblazon on our banners - and I am not referring only to the new Member States and their development aid policy but to all of us.
At a UNESCO meeting some years ago in Casablanca, the issue was raised of whether to make the entire Alpine Region a World Heritage Site.
This type of unilateral measure, which ignores the lessons of history, which puts a dramatic halt to the process which has taken many years and still needs to be promoted, is the exact opposite of what we should be doing.
A financial perspective which is adopted unilaterally by the Council would in no way be binding on the European Parliament and that would not be in anyone's interest.
I do hope that does not mean that we are going to see a European Union regulation restricting us all to living in bungalows.
The entire affair is related to the operation of British intelligence services in Greece and the illegal transfer of prisoners through European airports.
The EU should not just be ensuring a high level of protection on its own doorstep but should also be advocating the same for the rest of the world, and this paradoxical softening of the export rules would have done nothing for the EU's credibility.
I voted in favour of the report on increased effectiveness between the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the other Structural Funds as I believe that the development of a strategic framework could ensure a common approach and capitalise on synergies between the various existing funds, with a view to achieving the objectives of cohesion policy as defined by the Treaties, thus meeting the expectations of citizens.
As early as the third ASEM Summit in Seoul political aspects such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law were successfully promoted from being the subject of a fruitful dialogue between the partners in the ASEM process to prompting relevant undertakings from leading ASEM politicians.
Not quite!
For the European economies, aviation is an immensely important factor, without which economic life as a whole would quickly fall apart.
What is happening, quite simply, is that consumer demand is stagnating in our society.
Mr Hänsch did a fine job of explaining how the enlargement process is one in which both the current and the future Member States of the European Union will benefit: everyone can benefit from this.
This is why I am hoping for a proposal from the Commission for such things as the transfer of more operational powers to the external offices, less bureaucracy, less stringent requirements and, for example, for parliamentary delegations to have political control over the choice of those projects.
However, Turkey still has a long way to go.
That is the case with island regions.

Belarus is the only country in Europe that executes its prisoners.
In both debates, Parliament demonstrated the alternative ways in which it can exert influence in spheres in which it does not have legislative competence: this afternoon as a political and public forum in which debates sometimes become heated, and now as a guardian of the rights of our citizens.

It is very clear in the European Council that while we do not in any way seek to justify any of the acts, we have to try to understand them to see how we can cope with it – not by talking to people who are engaged in it, because they will not listen to anybody, but we have to understand and study the root causes.
The report' s proposals are aimed at (page 38) "providing a structure for the relationship between the European Union and civil society", developing interaction with "regional and local actors", strengthening public confidence in the use of experts, etc... All these actions have the effect of bypassing the national States, which disappear from the scope of the report, when they should be the key element.
Interestingly enough, though, this requires research, and a new generation of technology, and the possibility cannot be excluded of this becoming part of the technologies and philosophy intrinsic to and incorporated in the reactor, perhaps in the fourth generation of nuclear power stations.
   The next item is the vote.
In other words, we would have been finished at 5 p.m.
Mr President, this ban is great progress and represents a true victory for campaigners across the South East of England particularly - as you could imagine - and across the European Union, many of whom have written to us in the House to demand the end of this cruel trade.
I call on you, Mr President, on behalf of this Parliament, to protest against this law in the name of European values, since the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as reproduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, provides for non-discrimination in relation to sexual orientation, and this law discriminates against sexual minorities.

(DE) Mr President, Montenegro is not just one of the world's most beautiful countries; it is also the Balkan country with the oldest tradition of independence in the modern era.
There are two more points I would like to mention. The idea behind the voluntary partnership agreements is to put an end to the trade in illegally felled wood and products made from this wood and to help to stop deforestation, forest degradation and their effects in the form of CO2 emissions, as well as the loss of biodiversity, throughout the world.
In fact, the same fate has befallen Spain, as well, because it, too, has been downgraded after adopting a savings package.

They are neatly shared out among the various states.
This approach and Italy's are skimming the edges of the EU Treaty, and the Commission must make it crystal clear where the boundaries lie.
Lastly, it is important that this legislation enters into force as soon as possible and that the Member States make every endeavour to ensure that it is implemented effectively.
In addition, we are in the grips of a cruel financial, economic and social crisis, which has had devastating effects on goods transport.
Finally, I would like to add to what Diana Wallis said.
Our committee takes the view that, at least for the time being, there is no need for either a directive on port-related infrastructure, fees or terminals, or a directive on market access for providers of port services.
I discussed these issues with each of you at some stage over the last few months.
Free trade is not an end in itself, it has to serve the needs of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries; this is why the ACP group of nations has to be involved gradually and asymmetrically, so as to take account of local characteristics.
In the case of fresh or processed products that have a single ingredient, the country of origin should be indicated in order to allow consumers to make conscious, well-informed decisions about what they are buying.
My father's small business remains small.

The European Council in Gothenburg must make it clear that Ireland' s rejection will be respected.
Mr President, I would like to begin by stressing the importance of this report by Parliament on the application of the European Union’s information and communication strategy, and I would also like to thank the Commission for its good attitude, since, for the first time, before its presentation, this strategy has been debated with Parliament, thus allowing Parliament to influence its final content, rather than being restricted merely to responding to it.
   Mr President, Commissioner Wallström, honoured guests in the gallery, ladies and gentlemen.
There is perhaps not a single MEP who doubts the need for cohesion policy to continue after 2013.

This House should recognise and change its tone on what it sees as Article 13.
The next item is topical and urgent debate.
Following the vote on Amendment No 70
Good though it is that this joint declaration should have been made, I have to say that I find its content rather vague, for it has nothing to tell us about what Europe's future is supposed to be like or - and this is the most important - about how the man and woman in the street are supposed to be involved in it, and so, as we look forward to the second half of your presidency, we look forward to proposals as to how that is to be accomplished.
In Greece, a year after implementation of the new Common Market Organisation (CMO) in cotton, production is down by 20%, and in Spain by more than 50%.

Let us remember that these violations are not isolated, one-off occurrences but routine everyday practice in Tunisia.
Despite all opposition on the part of a number of Member States and despite all warnings and protests from some interested parties in the electricity sector, my instinct tells me that we can amend the original regulation without any problems.
Also on the same day, 22 years ago, the first partly-free parliamentary elections took place in Central and Eastern Europe, in Poland, where candidates of the democratic opposition won, taking almost all the seats which were open to a free vote.
You will, therefore, experience a lot more pleasure, Mr Rocard, in negotiating and battling with the Council, which will surely want to grant less than the Commission proposes.
We cannot, in fact, ask that everyone everywhere has the right to part-time work.
The second point I want to mention concerns the special effort we must make to promote libraries in the European Union's major cities which specialise in the culture, civilisation and knowledge of other peoples and languages of the EU.
European contract law should ensure a more smoothly-running Internal Market and this report draws particular attention to the potential benefits for SMEs and consumers.
That is the situation.
The situation is rather different in the Czech Republic, where we have the impression that the system and the Czech contribution to it are being pushed through against the will of the people, since I believe that 70% of Czechs are against the development of the system.
As you know, in 2005 the European Commission adopted a Recommendation on the cross-border management of legitimate online music services.
Having said that, I do not in the least intend to give up the widely - and internationally - shared view that human rights are universal, which is why no specific context can justify the death penalty, whether in Pakistan or in the United States.
(PL) Mr President, today the European Parliament is taking a second look at the draft directive on ambient air quality.
He quite rightly calls for the strengthening of actions in areas such as literary translation, the promotion of European languages, the teaching of art and the cultural industries, but also in the protection and promotion of our heritage.
I consider it of the utmost importance to adopt a position in harmony with the Member States' foreign policies, since such cohesion will lead to peace, security, solidarity and conflict prevention at international level.

Kaliningrad's economic indicators are mainly negative and still show no definite upward tendency.
The answer is that we, the developed world, are doing very little indeed, yet we are asking Latin American to bear the burden of the adjustment.
That is truly decentralised cooperation.

If we want to talk about human rights, then let us do so and stop talking about money and the safety of traffic under the Channel.
Anyone who has been to Africa, for example, will have seen the major role played by women in the development process.
As the rapporteur has said, the presence of women amongst the observers coming from the enlargement countries is really low; some countries have not presented women at all as observers, and we fear that, following the elections to the European Parliament, this presence will be no greater than 15%.
I shall soon present a joint paper on the EU’s overall policy on Kosovo with Javier Solana.
Of course we are not surprised that the capitalist EU deifies entrepreneurship.
So how should we do it?

Commissioner, Mr President, by creating a Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means and appointing its own President as chairman of that committee, which is not normal, this Parliament wished to give a clear demonstration of its interest and political commitment to a process which is so sensitive and essential to the future of Europe.
We too oppose any cantonisation of Kosovo.
I am confident that the Commission will examine this matter in a proper manner doing justice to the interests involved.

Who knows?

It is too early at this stage for us to respond in detail to all the issues raised in this exercise.

We must not allow this to happen in future.
This is particularly important for the European Union's poorer Member States.
Despite what some subjective studies would have us believe, it is not the 13% of Europeans downloading cultural content illegally who are threatening our culture, but it seems to me that it is the concentration of our culture in the hands of a few large groups that is damaging our diversity and therefore the richness of our cultural heritage.
Yet we chose not to support the rapporteur because the amendments he has proposed will adversely affect safety, our safety, the life span of tyres and their road-holding properties.
There is just one subtext, which is the economic subtext and this, unfortunately, outweigh humanitarian considerations.

Even forty years after signing the Treaty of Rome, only legal scholars and other experts in Community law are likely to find the fishing policy in the treaty creating the European Community, and then to find it hidden, in fact, once in article 38 and a second time in annex II, chapter 3 between edible slaughtered waste, birds' eggs and natural honey.
Numerous irregularities occur in many countries, such as the creation of fictitious documentation of waste collections, for example, in a practice known as invoice trading.

– Mr Belder, on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, on Ukraine (B5-0132/2004);

The code of conduct is intended to ensure that the clubs offering training actually take proper charge of these young people and do not train them simply as sportsmen but offer them an all-round education and preparation for life, for of course not everyone who has received sports training will become football stars or even have a professional career in the game.
In my opinion the Members should also know what is being voted upon.
By signing, the Treaty introducing the single currency and launching the political cohesion process, back in 1992, Europe knew that it was embarking on a journey that should completely transform both the institutional model and the overall shape of the Union, by gradually abandoning the geopolitical structure of the Cold War.

We are committing more than EUR 10 million in the same period to Mercosur's institutionalisation and there is a third chapter of assistance for civil society.
I am completely in favour of the creation of this Fund because I am convinced that the philosophy which underlies it - sharing risks, following market criteria, mobilising private investment, stimulating and rewarding professional effort - is European audiovisual production itself.
That, to my mind, would be the best approach.
A precise inventory of the new priority sectors, where closer and more organized cooperation could be of mutual advantage, should be drawn up as a matter of urgent necessity.

With this new regulation, we hope that this immigration liaison officers network will become more effective.

I would like to remind you of the fact that several years ago now Parliament put forward measures on these issues.

That became convincingly apparent to the first five-man delegation from this House, instigated by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, who recently visited Afghanistan - not only Kabul, but also up-country.
This situation illustrates the fact that there is still little evidence in real life of the many reforms that exist on paper, that many reforms in terms of minority rights – those of the Kurds, for example – have even ground to a complete standstill and that we in this House must closely monitor developments over the next few months.
Ensuring Europe's energy security is a priority issue, and the Commission's proposal to submit a European Strategic Energy Technology Plan to the 2008 Spring European Council is therefore very welcome.

I would now like to turn my attention to a fundamental aspect, that of always clearly making the distinction between harmful tax competition, which calls for Community-wide action in order to eliminate the effects that in the end are negative for everyone, and the opposite concept of positive tax competition which is beneficial and is stimulated by competition within the single market and monetary union, and that we could also say is an answer to the requirements of international competitiveness which the Union is having to face in the globalized economy.
This is difficult, but I think that it is necessary, because otherwise we can expect a real crisis over the legitimacy of the current European economic and social model.
That is not ideological. It is an expression of many health professionals and non-governmental organizations who are crying out for commonsense solutions to common problems across the continent.
Madam President, before the summer break the Parliament's Bureau finally decided that it would publish the names of all the assistants of Members paid under Article 14 secretarial allowances, but since then we find that the Bureau and the Quaestors have qualified their decision and are requiring the individual consent, of both the Members and the assistants, before they appear upon the list.
The need for economic and political reforms in this country is greater than ever.

I also think it is a missed opportunity for the banks themselves.
Today, there was an earthquake in Turkey in which at least 57 people died.
(ES) Mr President, all I wanted to do was to slightly contradict what Mr Leichtfried has said to spice up the debate a little.

Does the Commission agree that it is essential that this information be made available to the Community' s spirits drinks industry, giving them time to respond before any decisions are taken at Commission Management Committee level?
Finally, I would like to point out that it is not sufficient to map out and restrict the risks pertaining to these new production methods.
We cannot be accomplices to such actions.
The recommendations of the Extractive Industries Review in this regard are consistent with a recognised need to move to less carbon-intensive sources of energy.
The report identifies all these points as priorities for future action.
In the light of the extraordinary event and unilateral actions for peace, whereby the PKK chose to abandon the armed struggle and implement a ceasefire, and in the light of numerous leaders of the PKK choosing to turn themselves in to the Turkish authorities in order to reaffirm their choice of wishing to negotiate for peace, the Turkish Government gave only negative and scornful responses.
But in Europe, we had the tragedy of 'the commons', where we said it was a common resource to which all vessels had equal access.
However, we believe it is a programme worth keeping.
Last week, Radio Sweden reported on an audit that had revealed major shortcomings in how EU funds are used in Turkey.
Thank you for your attention!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the political situation in Burundi was once again totally reversed in the past two months.
We must also encourage stronger competition on the local telephone markets to make Internet connection cheaper.
We were speaking this morning about tackling discrimination, and it is very strange that those who support the abolition of discrimination do not want to protect human dignity by applying self-regulation to advertising.
Parliament and the Council have indicated that we consider it important, as a result of the failure in Spain of the fisheries agreements with Morocco, that money be set aside for the regions in question.
There is no such thing as a British citizen if you are not Irish from Northern Ireland, Scottish, Welsh or English.

Madam President, colleagues, if there is one thing the European Parliament can be proud of, it is its resolute, unshakable conviction that the death penalty must be abolished worldwide, and that it must fight to ensure that the death penalty is not carried out where it exists under the legislation.
At this point we can do something.
At the same time, in terms of airspace, progress has been made in that a single European flight information area in the upper airspace has been created and in that the Commission has produced a common publication on aeronautical information in that area; these are established facts.
I am not too sure why we should make the overstatements that we do about public sector broadcasting.
The Commission drew up an excellent, very balanced and scientific programme, with a great sense of the future, and which aimed to be a document that would arrive in Johannesburg with all the dignity of Europe, proclaiming a viable, feasible environmental policy that is accessible to all and can be implemented and made a reality.
It is deplorable that the socialists and other left-wing Members should have rejected the proposal for an oral amendment, tabled by the rapporteur himself just before the vote on a sensitive amendment - Amendment No 11, on the setting up of a temporary committee - which might have produced an even broader consensus on the final wording of this excellent and comprehensive report.
Needless to say, the developments in Ukraine are also an important indicator of that Policy’s success.
As you know, the measures we proposed known as the 'Erika I and Erika II packages' have been approved, with the exception of the European Compensation Fund for Tanker Pollution.
This obviously calls for additional resources, by which I mean not just the structural funds or funds allocated to agriculture, but also to resources for research and development, science and education.
That is how markets operate.
However we cannot hesitate for much longer, we need to decide.
The purpose of this, however, is not to demonstrate that the whole thing is too expensive but on the contrary to seek ways of achieving our political objectives, in other words enlargement, while bearing in mind that such schemes depend on popular support in both the European Union and the applicant countries.
This, to my mind, is the justification for this compromise resolution and I would like to thank those of my colleagues who helped to draft and support it, especially Mr Purvis and Mr Dary.

As regards imports from third countries, we must have the same provisions as for Member States.
I mention these examples, as they are the ones I am most familiar with, but the same happens in the United Kingdom, Germany, and I should think it also occurs in France.
I would much rather use this summit meeting as a historic opportunity to look at the whole question of employability and how we can boost employability in the European Union.
It was a year in which the European Union, with unprecedented cynicism and hypocrisy, implemented policies and guidelines that resulted in the significant increase in poverty and social exclusion that we can see today.
If a Sierra Leone scenario is repeated in Guinea there is a risk that in addition to Central and East Africa, West Africa too will be caught up in a spiral of violence.

However, good governance must also be incorporated into the investment policy.
To the Committee on Development and Cooperation, of which he was also a member, he was able to bring his great experience and commitment in Africa.
We must not forget, in passing, that these methods lead to large-scale job losses, and destroy the environment, quality, tastes and biodiversity.
The second point is that the decision was also taken, in collaboration with the European Parliament, to be respectful of national law in that sense; and because there are huge differences between national laws, I would not like to say that one law is better than the other.
What we have heard from Mr Kovács echoes what we hear all the time from Mr Mandelson too.
Better fishing for the sustainable husbandry of the sea, calls for satellite monitoring, selective equipment, the protection of young fish, control of fishing time at sea in order to retain a European fishing fleet; restoring employment as a central focus of our political concerns: these are the priorities by which we should be guided.
How can it do that if it is not adequately equipped for its work?
It is time a case was brought before the European Court against the mandatory bonus/malus scale, the mandatory no-claim discount, the outlawing of interest-bearing sight accounts and other things.

The vast majority of the reports and legislative issues are handled directly in plenary by the corresponding Commissioners responsible.
The answer is not only improved intelligence and sophisticated security.
We need to give a window of opportunity to these people and provide them with the assistance to sustain themselves as they undoubtedly face the most difficult period economically they have ever faced.
By this we mean an error, a lack of qualifications, poor management of a nuclear power station or a pilot error leading to an aircraft crashing.
The European Community should create the situation where newspapers can more easily open correspondents' offices worldwide.
Whilst it is true that this type of disaster is in general difficult to avoid, it is no less true that the effects of these floods could have been less serious if certain measures had been taken in time.

I would therefore ask for the opinion of Mr Dell'Alba.
One example is the Gdańsk Declaration, signed by President Kwaśniewski of Poland and President Rau of Germany.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I expressly support the proposal that the Council has put forward for integrating Europol into the framework of the European institutions, on several grounds.
Mr President, I shall be voting against the Dell'Alba report, and more generally against the ECIP and MEDA programmes, which were basically designed to finance subsidies and loans to private companies investing in Latin America, Asia, the Mediterranean and in South Africa.
I also regret that the present resolution does not breathe a word about today’s anti-Semitic terrorism, about today’s anti-Semitic attacks, about the fact that today in our large cities, for example in Antwerp, Jewish people are being attacked by Arabs and Islamists who are today’s anti-Semites.
Let me remind you – as I know you are well aware – that there are issues that genuinely make us angry and to which we are vehemently opposed, such as part-time work, prostitution and abortion.
So we must make quite sure we convey our grave displeasure to Yeltsin, the duly elected President.
Thirdly, the generally positive Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors represents a substantial step forward as compared with the situation in 1994.
Finally, to say that the voting system will remain or become more complex is an understatement.
Strong emphasis has been placed on the role of the many other countries involved and on the need for a global dialogue – with which the Council wholeheartedly agrees – and there is clear agreement both that the EU should continue to take the lead internationally and that we should continue to place strong emphasis on delivering on our own programmes.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have almost come to an end, with what will no doubt be my last major European report, after 13 years as an MEP.

This year, we are at a crossroads in the truest sense of the word.
Even the original Member States committed to honour this principle when they welcomed among them the 12 new Member States.
President.
12. Banana sector (vote)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, an elephant lurks in the wings of this debate that we seem reluctant to identify.
Rather, I am saying it because we in the Group of the European People' s Party were always in favour of having as close a partnership and as friendly relations as possible with Turkey, and that is, of course, still true today.
Today, we are just transferring a couple of million euros here for Galileo and a couple of million euros there, but in the past it has been hundreds of millions of euros.
The Commission will be presenting an initiative in this connection at the end of this month, covering both rural and regional development.
It is also important that we achieve some measure of progress.
In conclusion, I should like to come to the question raised in the debate regarding the cooperation of the European Parliament with any such Intergovernmental Conference. In this regard, I would just make it clear that any such involvement and the extent of it would of course have to be laid down in the Council Decision on convening the Intergovernmental Conference in which the modalities for involving other institutions in the conference would have to be set out.

Can we afford, Commissioner, to continue to suffocate ourselves with a dogmatic policy of stability, which is seen as an end in itself?
It is therefore quite impossible to understand why the Council and the Commission have bowed to pressure from the alcohol lobby to such an extent.
Is this the way to open doors?
Second Bandarelli report (A4-141/97)
I do not know whether the Member is asking the President-in-Office of the Council to assess a practical matter. I rather think that is impossible.
There were problems.
At the same time, we must make up for our neglect.
I also believe we have improved on the work of the Commission because we are giving the regulators the time needed to do their work.
Even though the references to natural radiation have been removed from the directive, the framework directive is still in place and still obliging employers to protect workers from the hazards of sunlight.
If we look at Mrs Weiler's report in that context, I think that we should also have the courage to decide amongst ourselves that we must not discriminate against employees from other countries who work here with the necessary permits, because this is what it is actually all about.
Mr President, in line with Parliament's rules and the conditions governing the conduct of its proceedings, the honourable Member will receive the same answer I gave to Mrs García Arias in writing, as provided for in the Rules of Procedure.
It is not the Commission that should decide how public monies are used but, ultimately, the taxpayers themselves.

I genuinely hope that the Commission on Petitions succeeds in establishing good levels of co-operation with the other committees in the coming year.
The current regulation expires on 31 March 2003 and a new regulation will be necessary.
The absurd deadlock over Galileo, which means that we remain dependent on external systems in the fundamental area of satellite navigation, shows, on the contrary, to what desperate impasses the Community method can lead. The ability of a few, more flexible, links in the chain to cause deadlock is enough to paralyse a project that is crucial to European independence.
   – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is undoubtedly a need for reform of the regime governing Type C Sugar, partly in view of the latest developments at the WTO, but we believe this should be included within the key points of the overall CAP reform.
The external commercial policy of the European Union must help to correct these problems by providing the instruments needed to promote fair trade.
And, of course, we need to pursue the economic policies that are so important for us in Europe, namely in terms of economic and social cohesion - not only for 16 - or 17, because I hope that Estonia will join the euro area very soon - but for all the 27 Member States.
While catch levels for the first are already high, and it would be very difficult to increase their capacity, it seems that there is greater scope for exploiting skipjack tuna; and the small increase in catches that may result from this agreement will therefore not substantially affect stocks.
(The sitting was closed at midnight.)
My question now is about whether this proposal will be debated again by one working party or another or in the Council of Ministers.
Madam President, happily we do not need to wait for Turkey's young people to learn about Europe.
After all, we in this House encounter problems of interpretation every day - as happened this afternoon, for example, when the English booth 'blew up' .
So there are some innovative features that should make our debates a little more lively.
We do not believe that a common constituency of that kind would add anything of great importance at this stage.
One of the proposals that the EP has adopted and which I tabled in the Committee of Employment and Social Affairs seeks to ensure that the joint report on social protection pays ‘particular attention to poverty issues and to progress in social inclusion within the EU Member States and in the accession countries’.
When we give in and ease off this pressure, losing sight of the advantages for the European economy as a whole, then we are sealing ourselves off and putting our collective head in the sand.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Setting product standards is not simply a technical matter.
If that is the aim of certain governments and of the terrorist fundamentalism that they maintain, we need to have the courage and the loyalty to say that Europe’s primary task is to support and defend the existence of the State of Israel and its people and to demand its recognition by those who still refuse to grant it out of short-sighted folly.
Madam President, am I right in thinking that there will be an opportunity for questioning the Commissioner under the catch-the-eye procedure at the end of his statement?
I would also like to point out to the Commission that it must continue to investigate the possible effects of BST on consumers' health.
I very much agree with the point which he has raised and I look forward, like he does, to the Commission proposal.
Incidentally, I am pleased that the Council is still here.
It would be a long road but the only sensible one for Iran.

At the same time, this also demonstrates that it is not possible to have a zero dioxin value.
My concern, Commissioner, is quite legitimate.
We need to raise public awareness and to bring citizens closer to the EU.
By way of an aside, it would be worth adding to this list something that was mentioned by previous speakers, namely improved communication from and to Strasbourg, and an increase in the efficiency of measures taken by the individual services of the EU institutions.
Greece has also, however, shown itself worthy of the classical humanism as expressed by Gorgias, who said 'man is the measure of all things'.
The citizens' initiative is necessary, no doubt, but to collect one million signatures in order to be heard is nonsense.
On the issue of mainstreaming I congratulate my colleague, Mrs Kokkola, on her report.
Now, moreover, - and I take advantage of the fact that Mr Kallas is here - the Commission is placing in doubt the future central crossing of the Pyrenees in the future core network.
This behaviour strikes me as a flagrant breach of Community law.
We want the 2004 deadline to be adhered to, so that these peoples can take part in the next European elections.
The Union urgently needs agreements on who may come in but is now directing most of its efforts to deportation.
Yet I echo your sentiment that it is very important to get this funding off the ground quickly, as projects are ready and waiting, and can be started immediately.
Are we on the side of repression, the introduction of an alien way of life, a comfortable life, good health and money, or of a peasant, nomad past, which admittedly entails poverty and widespread disease, but preserves one's own culture, and of freedom?

2. Democratic Republic of Congo: clashes in the eastern border areas (vote)
The present report relates to the Rasmussen and Lehne reports, both from 2008, and deals with the proposal for a directive on alternative investment fund managers.
The first is that we continue to take an inconsistent line in dealing with the economic crisis and the difficulties of the euro.
I agree with the rapporteur's proposal to organise an information campaign for citizens at a national level, aimed at increasing efficient energy use, during which home and flat owners would have thermal images taken of their property and would be given information on their energy efficiency and offered recommendations on the funding of possible modernization works by requesting microcredits.
Quite the opposite.
Eastern Germany requires support. However, some western German regions require European aid, as do parts of the United Kingdom.
When I introduced this directive I told them it would never be approved.
The foreseeable reaction of producers to the presence of independent producers in the spare parts market will be to offset their losses through higher prices.
I agree with Mrs Lulling, when she advocates improvement.

Today, the peoples of Europe have not been given an honest explanation of the ultimate objectives the single currency hopes to achieve.
In the second case, we have a country that has to combat terrible internal guerrilla warfare and where there have been serious human rights violations, including the frequent killings of trade unionists.
Norwegian assistance has played an indispensable part in this.
That is what we will demonstrate in a few hours, for example, at the G20 summit; at least, I very much hope so.
Firstly, I believe that we should be a little mistrustful of high-sounding slogans and goals such as the Lisbon objectives, to which we are constantly referring.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the idea of a transnational European Volunteer Service is to be welcomed - and I should like to express to the rapporteur my appreciation of all the work she has done -, I fear that the objective set out in the report will not be achieved due to a lack of funds.
During the summit, the matter of the equal treatment of EU Member States in the visa waiver programme should be made a priority.

Can the non-application of the trade defence instruments in 2007 also be interpreted as an indicator, or is it just coincidence, and other factors are in play?

The Commission is perfectly aware of the specific difficulties that arise in these sectors as a result of increased fuel prices.
This is quite simply how science works, and as far as I can see, science hinders this research as little as possible.
These trends will continue to grow and there is no reason why they cannot be accommodated.
So, we would ask that it comes forward.
I think we can actually be very proud of the fact that the impact assessment developed by the Commission has an extremely good reputation internationally, and, while I do not believe that you will find anything better anywhere in the public sphere, there is still room for improvement, and that is something we can work on together.
Moreover, the Commission is adopting a provision that permits the placing on the market of articles containing asbestos in accordance with a system that could vary from one country to another.
Our Committee on Constitutional Affairs backs what she has said and if we can do that, next year we will discuss politics more and process less.
That is of course work for the IGC.
The draft Commission regulation which we are discussing today does not provide all the necessary guarantees, nor the normal principle of caution in the absence of necessary scientific requirements, to ensure that nutrition and health claims are not misleading.
We now expect them to move on to actions.
I would appeal to both the Council and to Baroness Ashton, whom I wish well, to reinvigorate the Union's engagement with this process - not just looking towards the Quartet to reinvigorate its engagement with the process - and to put in place a timetable coinciding with the Palestinian authority's two-year timetable for the implementation of the principles we outlined, so bravely in my view, last week.
The report is in actual fact very realistic, and Parliament can now no longer be accused of consisting of extremists with their heads in the clouds.

We have proposed additional Community financing of 60%: firstly, for mergers between producer organisations and associations of producer organisations; secondly, for regions where the level of the concentration of the supply through producer organisations is below 20%; thirdly for organic farming; fourthly for new Member States and, finally, for the outermost regions.
That is, however, what happens in the case of women who are raped.
It was too painful to listen to.
The Commission's tight-fisted proposal on agriculture is rejected by the majority of the candidate countries.

Mr President, we believe that economic and social development is not an abstract concept but is combined with the fundamental concepts of peace, safety, respect for the environment and, not least, respect for human rights.
The rest of the text would have to be deleted because the Australians have removed it from their proposal, although that will not preclude others retabling it at the Conference of the Parties, if necessary.
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion.
That is, of course, a long way from the declared objectives.
I believe everyone shares these concerns.
For 2005 the current financial plans provide for EUR 119 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 114 billion in payment appropriations, which corresponds to 1.09% of gross national income.

Some play on people's fears.
Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, I hope that the terrorist atrocity on 11 September had the same effect on the Council, that is to say the Interior and Justice Ministers, as it did on the Heads of State and Government, namely that of shaking them awake and bringing it home to them that national resentments and animosities have no place in the fight against terrorism.
This Agreement reached Parliament a few months ago, during a consultation procedure.
This work and - it is a little disappointing that so few representatives of the Council are here today - this decision are extremely welcome in the light of an extremely difficult discussion between the Member States in the past.

Closure of sitting
(PT) Prime Minister Sócrates says he has received a clear and precise mandate.
In response to your question, the amount of any correction will have to take full account of the audit findings, but the consequences in terms of loss of Community funds cannot be quantified at this stage.
I voted in favour of changing the title of the draft resolution on freedom of information in Italy, following the European Commission's statement of 8 October 2009, to delete the word 'Italy'.

As regards the equivalence decision, it is right to postpone it.
I am talking about a whole range of standards, from health and plant health measures to technical standards - especially in the agricultural and automotive sectors - export subsidy rules, customs checks and factors allowing for counterfeiting and also triangular trade with China and Korea.
That concludes Question Time to the Commission.
It is important that we should be speaking today of an action plan and its details; this shows that we are taking concrete steps in this direction.
The problem is that we believe that this Directive is not sufficiently clear or complete and, for example, does not provide for the possibility of cross-funding of alternative infrastructures, an issue which appears to be essential if we are to establish adequate infrastructures within the European Union.

I would like to make it very clear that we, through the fourth supplementary and amending budget, were spontaneously and quickly in a position to increase the appropriate resources and to make said resources available.
I want to make it clear that those same flag-wavers over here on my left, those same people who claim to defend the rights of Irish people were the same people who appeared on Irish television celebrating a 'no' vote in Ireland in a pub in Brussels.
Madam President, there is some confusion.
In this sense, we see a balanced report containing commitments that can be realistically met, which is why I strongly support it.
On 25 June 2001, the Council reaffirmed its commitment to promoting the European human rights policy and the policy of democratisation in third countries and issued a series of basic principles designed to bring about a more creditable, coherent, consistent human rights and democratisation policy. We need consistency between Community action and the common foreign and security policy as well as development policy through close cooperation and coordination between the competent bodies of the European Union.
In the same way that we need to reduce motoring, we also ought to dare to say that the current soaring meat consumption is not sustainable.
Since it is essential to adjourn our debate at 5.30 p.m. for Question Time with the Council, I would call on Mr Secchi to present his introductory remarks as rapporteur, but I would inform him that we shall be obliged to continue the debate this evening after 9 p.m.
You are forced to swerve and you hit a tree, knocking yourself unconscious.

The other matters referred to were dealt with in my reply.

An excessive, discriminative, and structurally distorting crisis tax.
Vice-President of the Commission/ High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, we have all been watching very closely the recent events in Tunisia and more lately in Egypt.
This conference should take place at the end of a moratorium, a determined dialogue between the scientific world, ethics commissions and political leaders on the subject, which is so serious and new to all of us, that many of us are bewildered and have no reliable points of reference on the subject.

When it comes to analysing the significance of 11 September, on the other hand, a considerable gulf is developing between the two sides of the Atlantic, with one side regarding it as an isolated operation and the other as a manifestation of the new global terrorist scene, dominated by hyperterrorism.
Outright rejection of the Council's proposal does not seem wise if we are to move ahead with the Statute according to the agreed timetable.

In a globalised world, no country can solve all its problems on its own.
Only 10% is spent on new innovative research. As such, the framework programme certainly makes a considerable contribution to this 10%.
I believe that we have to put all our experience, all the lessons we have learnt in Haiti and elsewhere, and also enough money, into the pot.
That evaluation should tackle every aspect of fishing activity, including its biological, economic, social, technological, cultural and even anthropological aspects.

Mr President, I know that speaking times can never be planned precisely, but it has quite often been the case that we have had a break after the urgent debate, and now we have one again before the vote.
However, the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and exacerbating unemployment.
The presidency continues to support the proposals it has put forward, and we are delighted that most of them - and I have told you about one exception to this - have met with approval.
By 2010, European industry must be the world’s most competitive economy.
Furthermore, this report stresses the need to combat protectionism, which unfortunately is present in many of our current European governments, and we also warn that the risk associated with the euro-dollar exchange rate may threaten the quality of our economic growth.

On the other hand, I then think of the group of women who visited us here last month, to whom Mrs Durant also referred, and I wonder whether we could look them in the eye and tell them that we are simply giving up, or that it is not one of our priorities, or that we mean to just adopt yet another resolution and consider our job done.
May I commence by extending my regret to all of you for not being here at the commencement of this debate.

Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Theato on the report which I supported in the Committee on Budgetary Control and which I also expect to support in this plenum.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a directive intended to fight marine pollution, and this will not be the only one this year.
But the amendments relating to the draft Statute and the points of principle of the draft Statute are put onto the annex side and the questions relating to the annex side are put on the draft Statute side.
The Markov report paints a very positive picture, particularly, of course, since it refers to the last few years.
It gives us a good chance to clear things up and to ensure openness and transparency in all the institutions.
Finally, I support the words of Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the Opposition Party, who this morning on the BBC was very tough on Mugabe and I will quote what he said and finish with this: 'President Mugabe has clearly violated all the tenets of the Commonwealth and all other international organisations and should now be isolated from the international community.'

The debate is closed.
We need to make it quite clear that we are as concerned about the competitiveness of Europe per se as we are about cultural diversity in Europe, the cultural diversity that makes Europe what it is and - and this too is an important point in this resolution - the potential of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The first is that, if we do not want this new social approach to go unheeded, it must be accompanied by an action plan, by the re-launch of the European social agenda, and perhaps even by a Council that is dedicated - as the last one was to energy- and renewable energy-related objectives - to the implementation of these social objectives.
This proposal is of high political importance as the fund has attracted wide interest and these are high hopes for its success.
What that means is, quite simply, that I, the consumer, will in future - or at least after 1 July 2007 - have the right to choose an electricity company, 100% of whose electricity is generated from hydropower.
We disagree totally with the rapporteur's proposals for a form of 'economic government' The institutional edifice of the EU has no need of new political bodies or of any strengthening of the Commission's information-gathering powers.

Second, the Kremlin has a history of using economic instruments as political tools.
A number of people I have spoken with have lost their jobs because their employer was not flexible or understanding about MS. That is why implementing an EU directive on equal treatment in employment is so important.

The majority of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs come close to bringing about a more balanced definition, so they seem to me to be a useful addition to the common position and a good basis for a final decision.
Mr President, as I have already done on other occasions, I recommend that you also look towards the right side of the House, where often we have to wave our arms about to obtain the floor.
The objective should be a total overhaul of the financial system and public and social control, a more democratic summit which would include all states and would address issues such as increased unemployment and the spiralling cost of basic goods and fuel, a summit which would take fundamental decisions to intervene in the market in order to put a stop to continual privatisation and the destruction of the social state.
I thank the rapporteurs for their good work and hope that the continuation of the promises made will enhance the Union and the programmes that it has initiated.
In this way, I believe Council and Parliament, through common agreement, have got round the difficulty of the treaty's inflexibility, for the sake of greater realism and stringency in agricultural spending.

Potentially helpful measures include universal access to so-called ‘micro-credits’, which would help to combat poverty amongst women, promote self-sufficiency and raise their social status.
   The debate is closed.
Innovation is thus the starting point for all educational activity.
This Union must take a firm stand with the authorities in Equatorial Guinea and demand that prior commitments be honoured.
I find, sadly, that in some matters it does not go far enough.
In its note dated 13 March 2007, the German embassy in Harare, on behalf of all EU partners, emphatically called on the Zimbabwean Government to observe the principles of the constitution.
That is a very important result.
Indeed it seems to me that recent times have seen the transport industry being hit hard by piece after piece of excessive legislation.

Even more than the women, it was their sons, husbands and brothers who fell victim to a system that held human life in contempt and in violent conflicts, including American bombs and Vietnamese landmines, which, time and time again, blew people to their deaths or left them gravely wounded - something that they continue to do.
But to revert to old Keynesian recipes that have already shown their limitations would, in our view, be a mistake.

In the area of agriculture, where more clear-cut estimates will made in future, a reserve provided for by resources, is essential.
The European Union can be proud of having taken the lead in this area and it intends to continue its efforts in this direction, especially with the forthcoming Bali Conference and in the wake of major recent meetings such as the High-Level Event in New York and the G8 at Heiligendamm, which also proved decisive.

It is hard to imagine what justification the Commission can possibly have for working on a mandate that is six years old and which, therefore, fails to reflect any of the important changes that have happened since it was agreed.
So what we will end up achieving is to halt this kind of research, which really is not acceptable.
Jean Monnet, the founding father of Europe, once said: 'When an idea matches the needs of the time, it ceases to belong to the people who invented it and it is stronger than those who are in control of it', and he added, 'there are no premature ideas, there are opportune moments that you have to know how to wait for'.
Nor is it the case that the Swedish principle of public access to official records is guaranteed by this proposal.
That is why the Russian Government must be told that, if they, in effect, label an entire people, and its elected representatives, as terrorists, then by so doing they are depriving themselves of the last partner with whom they can even attempt to resolve this problem in a peaceful way.
(Laughter and heckling)

At this time it is important to have special consideration for the island and outermost regions which, in addition to their permanent obstacles, are now confronted with devastated infrastructure and personal, commercial and agricultural property, and, in many cases, not being able to resume normal activities immediately, particularly in the regions that depend almost exclusively on tourism, as the media portrayal of the events could deter potential visitors.
Can we trust our governments to preserve our national, European and regional cultures?
Industrial and technological change increases the demand for workers with high and intermediate skill levels, with low-skilled labour being squeezed out.

All I can say is that unless that amendment is passed, there is no deal with the European Union.
I hope that, at noon today, we will be courageous enough to show this to the Council and the Commission by an overwhelming majority.

They are facing rigid restrictions on production capacity and, of course, I know that these were the condition for high subsidies in the nineties.
2 - that it should be possible for elected representatives to be removed from office at any time by the people who elected them.
Action taken on Parliament's resolutions: see Minutes
The directive aims to adapt existing legislation to reflect developments in IT such as the Internet.

The stability pact concerns the crisis in the western Balkans, in former Yugoslavia.
I welcome this because I feel that we can learn from both Davos and Porto Alegre, although proposals have been made in both places that cannot be taken very seriously.
This is why we must find new solutions to the energy supply issue in the EU, bearing in mind the need for competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply.
It was clear at that time that unless these protocols were taken very seriously, we could end up with a rather dangerous situation.
Its value must therefore be exploited, for economic purposes certainly, but it also has a social value which must be exploited for the benefit of the general public, for example by guaranteeing wide accessibility for all citizens, including the disadvantaged, by bringing broadband services to the most remote areas of our country and thus eliminating the digital divide which is still a feature of so many parts of Europe, and I am not just thinking of rural areas but also of urban and industrial areas.
I should nonetheless like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Konrad, for the sound work he has done and for having tried to move things in the right direction.
I hope that these proposals will result in us being able to systematically resolve the problems that remain in this area following previous efforts, including those of Mr Gauzès and the previous Commission and the Council - for which we are grateful; and that we are able to do so without creating a new monopoly, but rather by consistently getting to grips with the problems of incentives and regulation.
Women are bountifully offered flexible forms of employment, with the result that they provide cheap labour, receive less money for the same job and face worse problems of job insecurity and unequal access to the labour market. It is still mainly women who fill the more menial, unskilled jobs and who rarely hold responsible, higher management jobs in economic, social and political life.
From now on, the Union will be better equipped to provide the answers people expect of it, both internally and externally.
A monitoring centre cannot replace the political will to prevent big business sacking workers to make bigger profits.

I think the desired simplification of the Structural Funds is a good thing, with a large Objective 2.
Mr President, Commissioner de Silguy, ladies and gentlemen, I must say, like the rapporteur, that I too am aware that we currently have little room for improving the euro coins.
Consequently, what I should like to hear from you, in addition to what you have already said, which is highly satisfactory, is whether we really are prepared to make available the sum needed, because this sum will be much larger than the sum we already have for the bridge programme or the sum of around EUR 12 million budgeted for the early warning system.
Right at the start, I would like to make it clear that the EU is giving its full support to the stabilisation and normalisation of Georgia and to democratic reforms in the country.
In my country, Poland, alone, the actions of the European Commission have led to the collapse of the shipbuilding industry and, as a result, many thousands of people have lost their jobs directly, while it is estimated that indirect job losses have been suffered by nearly 80 000 people.
This includes an immediate consensus between Member States regarding the creation of a common social security and taxation status, and that should be done now, and not in two years time when the experiment has failed.
Finally, I will make a general comment on what Mrs Schreyer pointed out in her speech.
I have been informed about them.
All credit to the Spanish.
When the Commission launched its draft directive on the improvement of safety in tunnels, I was, on the one hand, glad that it is fundamentally in accordance with the third action programme to improve road safety, which we had welcomed, but I was also concerned and disturbed by the prospect of an enormous increase in bureaucracy and of the high costs resulting from it, which, it appeared, would devolve upon the Member States.
I should prefer to focus on the possibility of using biotechnology to design new pesticides and chemicals which work where they have to work and are broken down when they have to be broken down.
Let us try to understand what is happening in the Israeli Government: if a person such as Mr Liebermann, a racist and xenophobe, assumes power, what will we say?
It would be wrong to decide on a common EU eco label that leads to the abolition of labelling systems that are already functioning well and highly regarded.
Then of course there is the 'get them on board' scenario, irrespective of whether the plane is going to leave or not.
We need to arrive at a fairer distribution of the beneficiaries of international protection among Member States.
I expect appropriate steps to be taken, particularly since the man in question aspires to the position currently held by Mr Pöttering.
It is true that the Member States still have some reservations.

That is why we have been so strongly committed to ensuring that the Copenhagen process leads to this legally binding agreement.
They do not make their profit in that way.

There is the protocol, which has been referred to.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing was of course not only the French President, he was also a Member of the European Parliament, and in the end a Member of our group.
I think Mr Posselt is talking about defending human rights, and as far as human rights are concerned, there are certain attitudes in Cuba which do not respect them adequately.
Thank you for your attention.
I discussed this with Mr Swoboda this morning and, as far as I understood, he accepts it.
Hopefully these will lead to the Charter of Fundamental Rights becoming legally binding.
The foregoing also demonstrates that, if environmental protection is to be effective and ecological disasters are to be prevented, the activities that come within the scope of the directive must be revised on a regular basis, together with an evaluation of the most recent scientific conclusions and the experience acquired in the meantime.

There is no doubt that it, despite certain defects, has, in many respects, achieved greater progress in its preparations for accession than have certain Member States, and that is why we have to put our own house in order and put the European Union in a position to be able to welcome Croatia without delay.
   Mr President, in the introduction to your speech, Mr President of the Commission, you said that it was important to demonstrate that Europe could make a difference.
We must point out that the data which has led to certain difficulties were not the data which appear in the ‘Passenger Name Record’ (PNR) and that they are sufficiently detailed to prevent certain types of errors which have been made in this field.

Until that time, however, conditions for the animals during movement must be improved.
, Security and Defence Policy. Mr President, I want to endorse the conclusions this report comes to.
At the end of these negotiations we can feel partially satisfied, but I would say very partially, because there is still a great deal to be done.
Despite the amount of bureaucracy involved, it is worthwhile involving the SMEs in this process, albeit by means of simplified processes, because they account for some 90% of European enterprises.
Rest assured that you will have my support for any measure that goes in this direction.
The Council noted, too, Croatia's cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, although it felt that further efforts were necessary.
Deletion itself is time consuming and at the consumer' s expense.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say that I am a little disappointed that after four years, we still have not seen a proposal from the Commission as to how we can tighten up the legislation on animal transport.

I would like to point out straight away that there is practically no difference.
We know that, in national politics, it is the parties that give structure and dynamism to political life.
If coordinating economic policy triggers a process of learning and competition, with people asking 'How do the other countries actually go about this?' then this will achieve more than illusionary spending programmes.
Community law lacks clarity.
I would especially like to thank Mr Schmitt, the outgoing Member, who was rapporteur.
I will just give you some examples which perhaps explain why the French are a little wary about Europe on this subject: the prices of postal services, rail transport, air transport and water transport, which have been given over to private companies, have increased exponentially.
(The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)
Of course we welcome the fact that many points in the European Parliament's proposals of December 1996 have been taken up.
Nobody but a fantasist would suggest such a thing.
Three kilometres from the border regions, I have been told!
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
I believe that the ultimate test is that we have launched the euro with tranquillity and calmness, with people understanding there will be stability in the euro-zone.
We have yet to reap the full benefits of the euro.
I tabled an amendment on this point, together with a few other Members, but although it was worded in very moderate terms, it has not, to date, been accepted.
You have been speaking for nearly two minutes.
There are SMEs that are very innovative but require a great deal more financial support, and there is a very young population that must be integrated and needs jobs.

   I shall take account of your request.
I should also like to say one last thing.
The debate is closed.
For that reason, I would like to make three points. Firstly, we do not need two administrative bodies for one agency; secondly, decision-making must be carried out where the work is being done, that is to say at the Kosovo Reconstruction Agency in Kosovo; and thirdly, it is important to work in co-operation with the local people and, more particularly, on a multi-ethnic basis, as has been emphasised here.
In fact, we see that a country's progress is very clearly linked to its capacity to integrate in a global economy.
With such widespread consensus from regulatory bodies, it seems wasteful to divert the overstretched EFSA from meaningful work into an endless cycle of re-evaluation.

I do actually still believe that this provision is essential to the effectiveness of judicial cooperation to combat money laundering.
I indicated at the beginning of Question Time that I wanted to do so.

The qualitative assessment was based on wide sampling of the projects with additional interviews with national bodies and, subsequently, with the initiators or promoters of these projects at grass roots.

If not, Europe is at risk of becoming a political dwarf on the international stage.

We have not achieved all that we set out to achieve.
In addition to aid and debt relief, a correctly liberated market is a very important, if not most important, instrument for distributing prosperity in the world more effectively and more evenly and for narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor.
The Council has promised that, in the next few years, the consultation period will be longer, and the Commission has also promised that it will submit its proposals more quickly.
Thirdly, this legal interpretation has been prepared in the Commission by our legal service and by our budget department and agreed fully in the Commission.
In doing so, we were mindful of the reservations of Parliament and, in particular, of your concerns on ensuring institutional balance with the Council.

This is, therefore, a global debate which we Members of the European Parliament must sustain throughout the next legislature. It must cover dioxin, hormones and GMOs which are all very controversial issues.
It is therefore a text that was born under difficult circumstances, but I would like to say at this point, because I have been surprised by some of the things I have heard, that it is not a text that introduces a tax or a toll: it is the individual Member States that will decide whether to introduce a tax or a toll.
We must not restrict cross-border health care just to those who can afford it.
Technical standards replace detailed legislative provisions and simplify the rules, which will at the end of the day make the entire European economy more competitive.

If we are serious about acting on the climate problem then we need to have many more applications of renewable energy.

Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, I warmly welcome this report, which I fully support.
We will examine questions to the Commission.

But before we can sign or approve this agreement here today, we need a political solution for the Western Sahara, and that means Moroccan withdrawal from the Western Sahara.
That being so, it is an important question.
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate my Welsh colleague for her excellent speech and I am also glad that there is basic agreement from all sections of the political spectrum.
This new directive, which will now be implemented in national legal systems within 24 months of its adoption, will therefore benefit the entire European economy.
   – Mr President, I wish first to thank all my honourable friends for their opinions and then to make two comments on what I have heard.
Even for water we have national legislation.
Do we want, in the short term, to see free trade throughout Africa and thus to push through the European Partnership Agreement (EPA) of all those countries, or do we want a stable, growing economy in Africa in the long term, with whom we can then do business more generously?
I congratulate Mrs Klamt and Mrs Karamanou, but on some points my group is not entirely happy.
I therefore hope that, based on the Presidency' s synthesis report, the European Council in Gothenburg will be able to draw up clear guidelines for continued work on sectoral integration.
We fully endorse the Community measures which were recommended in the Commission communication: advantageous taxation, that is, fiscal measures that offer conditions that are truly competitive in this market to the production sector - 95% of which, I would point out, is made up of small and medium-sized businesses, which is equivalent to 2 million small and medium-sized businesses in the European tourism sector; it awards special attention to vocational qualifications in the European Union, and therefore to investing in training; finally, it undertakes to make the job market transparent.
It is harder for people in these countries to tell the difference between real and fake notes and, in many cases, people are often less suspicious too.

But our free area relates to the freedom of movement of goods, money and services. There is still very little free movement of people.
In Estonia, you stated that the dumping of toxic waste in Ivory Coast was only the tip of the iceberg.
This will contribute to integration but, as I said during the debate that we have just concluded, it is not that easy to reach agreement concerning these conditions.
It might sound like a technical problem, but it is not.
Yet, when it comes to its relations with the United States, one often has the impression that Europe is scared of its own shadow.
'Soft' or 'permissive' law is a widely accepted dialogue-based form of European common regulatory policy involving coordination, cooperation, negotiation and hierarchy.
These are rights that must be earned first by operating more energy-efficiently before they can be auctioned.
We believe there is no way that alcohol consumption can be described as 'beneficial in moderation' .
How can we avoid a disproportionate burden on health funds?
I therefore believe that now is the time to set up some sort of independent international coordination centre.
We should therefore do well to specify that the draft regulation on the translation regime was not adopted by the Commission until 30 June 2010 and that the Council took note of the lack of unanimity and the difficulty of reaching a unanimous decision in the near future in November 2010.
During this Presidency, we will have low growth and unemployment will rise.
We will be giving that more of a cutting edge by means of an amendment, as it is our opinion that the subsidy of live animal transports still leaves too many openings for fraud involving subsidies that make no sense whatever to the EU's taxpayers.

B5-0086/2001 by Mr Obiols i Germà, Mr van den Berg and Mrs Napoletano, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the political situation in Algeria.
No, of course, not!

It may be in some countries with which he is particularly concerned but, in Europe and in civilised countries, the law is not a protocol formality.
   – Mr President, the Titley report is a positive step towards enhancing road safety.

Republic of Mauritania
They are the expression, they should be the expression of civil society, and therefore either civil society, the citizens (nobody has said anything about the citizens) give money to the parties, and so the parties survive because they are the expression of civil society, or they are condemned to die, as quite rightly they should die if they do not represent anyone.
Are we to be like Pontius Pilate, who washed his hands?
   .   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay tribute to Mr Pittella, the rapporteur, and to Mr Lewandowski, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets.

Just one more point, Mr President.
My question, however, was different and was about past results.
I took note, Mrs Vassiliou, of the Commission's wish to speed things up.
There is also a need for annual reports based on more detailed information about the work carried out by the institutions.
Of course it presupposes basic approval for the Commission proposals

Do you know who directed it?
It has the support of Parliament.
We will now go together to the press conference.
The association agreements with all the countries have led to more interchange, trade, projects and many shared fora, and it has given rise to a long-term commitment for the whole of the EU.

Second point: on the 26th, Commissioner Fischler - according to items in various parts of the media in my country - appears to have expressed his approval of considering additional concessions in the importation of fruit and vegetables originating from Morocco in the negotiation of the fisheries agreement.
There are, of course, various arguments that can be used to support this view; you could, of course, say that this is a case of subsidiarity, or that it is more important to adopt the report than the principled choice in Amendment No 20. To do so nevertheless infringes another right, namely the right of every European to be able to work within the European Union.
In the debate on chocolate, the word ethics was used more than once.
Mr President, we realize that these subsidies are necessary to create a level playing field on the world market.

In this context, as I proposed in my recent speech in Bruges, the European Council has asked the Council and the Commission to explore ways of enabling those that guard the Union' s external borders to cooperate effectively, and to look into the possibility of setting up a common mechanism or border-control service.
However, this afternoon we are talking about a small Finno-Ugric nation somewhere in the huge Russia.
In the other sectors we are making no recommendations that would result in a fall in market prices for olive oil or tobacco grown by tobacco farmers within the European Union.

This process involves threats and often violence against the activists who carry out this work.
The proceedings today have shown that, even when it is not used, it serves a purpose in putting on pressure for amendments to be withdrawn, thereby saving the rest of us a lot of time later in plenary.
If rural development is to strengthen the rural economy and keep pace with sustainable regional development, it needs resources and integrated planning.
I would like to make one final point. It cannot be the case that the new military resources which are required will be over and above the ones we have at the moment and that, as such, a new arms race would be created for military resources.
It was very interesting and very important.
But the idea of introducing a kind of newcomer quota and dividing this each year between those Member States where there is only very little flax and hemp production at the present time, or none at all, is, I believe, definitely worth exploring.

Our resolve for the future should be to pursue this idea further!
I can say what I like in this House, and that includes expressing my opinions about you.
Protecting the young, protecting children should always be given priority over the desire to give expression to individual sexual orientation.

Today, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the progress report on Turkey.
I am also very keen to build on the work that we do with the US in areas of development, for example, particularly in Africa, where there is a potential - I believe, anyway - to do a lot more, certainly in the light of my experience with Aid for Trade as the Trade Commissioner.
So if we really want to talk about a single currency associated with a positive solution to the real problems of European economies and social conditions, we need to have the courage to separate out what can be separated - in other words, the procedure for approaching the single currency - from the policies of the Maastricht Treaty, by putting on our agenda the one thing that is essential unless we really want to see the European currency achieved by bringing European civilization to its knees: the amendment and correction of the Maastricht Treaty.
Two: the exchange of traffic data and the creation of an information management service should be geared to intermodal transport from the outset.
I vehemently object, however, to the clearance sale of membership conditions that Parliament has agreed to today through its recommendation.
We should, then, carry through what the Austrian Presidency says it is seeking, namely an ambitious Services Directive that contributes to increased prosperity for us all.
I consider these measures to be absolutely necessary.
Can we work in France on 14 July as we commemorate the French Revolution?
I would call upon you to ensure that these 14 members also include representatives of the 49% who voted 'no' in the referendum on Maastricht in France and of the near enough 50% who voted 'no' in a couple of referendums in Denmark.
I understood Mr Giansily to mean that he wanted the seven Members who are speaking on behalf of the political groups to have the floor before Question Time.

The main challenge for the months to come is the launch of a real dialogue on the future of Europe.
I think it is a good thing we have Commissioner Kinnock in this post at this time.
Mr President, we have debated the Helms-Burton Act here many times and passed resolutions on it, and the position of my group with regard to the extra-territorial provisions in this Act is unchanged.
Let me emphasise and clarify at this point that nobody in our group is against the idea that we should join together in fighting international terrorism.
We definitely need a regulation to prevent the double taxation of premiums and benefits, and I hope that we shall have the considerable judgment required in order to devise a sensible regulation quickly.

Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Terrón i Cusí, and all those who have contributed to this very positive report which we are considering today.
The Basel Convention contains an express ban on the transport of harmful waste to non-OECD countries, which has thus been flouted.
Clearly, an enlarged Schengen area must not engender the risk of shutting out those countries which now adjoin the expanded Schengen borders.
We have the interests of consumers in Europe and elsewhere very much at heart, and trust that the WTO will not raise too many objections to the implementation of rules on health and information.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, may I thank the rapporteur for the excellent work she has done on this report.
I would also like to thank him for being more specific in response to proposals from my group.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have heard Mr Fabre-Aubrespy present his motion, and Mr Fayot in his capacity as chairman of the committee.
Personally, I do not support the idea of a special representative for Tibet because we already have enough means in our hands to facilitate such a dialogue.
How about that?
Structural funding must be more than a simple transfer of resources from the more prosperous Member States to the less prosperous ones - if that were all it is, this could be done simply by adjusting budget contributions and rebates.
This is nothing more than a precautionary measure, and I would like to reiterate that, for the time being, this is only at the first reading stage as we asked the Commission to provide clarification on the implementation of the single Statute, so that we could have very precise and realistic answers, particularly on the problem of early retirement schemes for civil servants and temporary staff, but also on the problems caused by absenteeism and vacancies.
By this I mean that cross-border care could constitute added value for people, that we could obtain better specialist health care and that patients could obtain better care of higher quality, sometimes at lower cost but, above all, in a more efficient way.
However, we still lag a considerable way behind our European partners in terms of our infrastructure, in particular transport, telecommunications and environmental protection facilities.
As Commissioner Patten mentioned, these developments are acknowledged in the STAR 21 initiative: the strategic aerospace review for 21st century currently in progress.
If, however, we then follow the discussion further into the realm of practical implications, we are told that there is no need to alter the practical policy guidelines.
rapporteur. - Mr President, firstly I would like to thank all the honourable Members concerned for their interesting input, and especially the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation.
To sum up, Madam President, consumer confidence, which is crucial if our farmers are going to find new hope, will only fully return when they see that in the European Union, public health protection comes before the dogma of free trade.
We cannot now refuse this extension, particularly in view of the extreme consumer distrust of food products and the increasing industrialisation of agricultural production methods.
In my country we have problems with finding enough space to develop wind power.
I say 'should ' no longer occur because I think one thing we are familiar with in all countries is the zealousness of parking attendants.
I therefore believe that this was a positive outcome – of course the outcome that was possible, given the make-up of the interests in question and of the controversy the issue has stirred up.
We will not have the European Union inherit this liberum veto, because we do not want it to be our undoing, and we will not allow the European Union to be led down a road that it must not go down.
But at the same time, we deeply deplore human casualties and call on the Turkish authorities to shed light on those events, through a comprehensive investigation, and to make sure that the security forces show the necessary strength in face of the demonstrators.
We need to ensure that research results can be protected by means of harmonised intellectual property protection, and translated into commercial products and processes through effective innovation and technology transfer.
But we should let the Commissioner have his wish!
Work is in progress, thanks to the commitment of the European Parliament and the European Commission.
We need human resources at all levels: at a national level in compulsory and university education, and at European Union level in top-level research.
However, I am confident that, utilising the new legal base, we can begin once again to put this issue on the map.
People did not understand it; the Government has been in power since 1994; politicians are appearing at tribunals of enquiry; the main government and opposition parties - the political establishment - wanted it passed.
People within the European Union are uncertain about enlargement.
   . The Duff/Voggenhuber report misjudges the political realities, both in the Netherlands and in France.
This role is crucial for strengthening Parliament's democratic powers, especially during the negotiation of major international conferences such as United Nations conferences on climate change.
The fourth area is capacities, which involves infrastructure, SMEs, regions and research potential.
Because the budgetary Stability Pact demands savings and cuts have to be made.
Equally positive is the report's insistence on the mutual recognition of qualifications, and its call for greater attention to be paid to early school leaving, to lifelong learning and to encouraging the learning of foreign languages, amongst other things.
Mr Nielson, let me take this opportunity to remind you that on 10 April our Parliament voted on a Resolution to freeze the Association Agreement.
(NL) First of all, I should like to express my compliments to the Swedish Presidency for the efforts it has undertaken over the past few months.
   Mr President, our democracies are based on non-negotiable principles: peace and freedom, mutual respect, equality and, if possible, fraternity.
I am not sure whether they understood that this would mean the European Ombudsman carrying out tasks currently belonging to the European Commission as the guardian of the Treaty, and to the European Parliament as the democratic forum to which citizens may address petitions.
in writing. - (FR) Despite its claim to be exhaustive, the report on human rights in 2006 does not mention any of the main causes of the violation of these rights: Communism, which still oppresses more than one and a half billion people, in China, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cuba, Zimbabwe, and I could go on. In every country in which they are in power, Communists deny people's fundamental rights, persecute their opponents, and send them in their millions to concentration camps.
Commissioner, do you think that is reasonable?
We also need a web site where we can present the work being done with regard to human rights, showing, for example, who is doing what and what results have been achieved. The web site could also contain links to different organisations.
I shall read them more slowly.
I also think it is important that when the systems are deployed, the aspects relating to compatibility, coherence and regulation are applied too.
We have also expressed our disappointment at the lack of progress achieved by the human rights dialogues and consultations.
Like the European Parliament, the Commission is also extremely concerned about these international fishing pirates and the use of so-called flags of convenience.
In any case, I am sure that this saved the taxpayer some money and as for the delegation from the European Union, we were pleased with the way the conference was organised.
Besides, European tobacco is so bad that only a fraction is sold on the European market. A third is burned.
To radiation, national borders present no obstacles.
This question echoes the questions worded in more general terms by previous honourable Members.
It is also necessary to be practical and not theoretical.
To be absolutely clear, this is not about the issue of having the seat of Parliament in Strasbourg – that is laid down in the Treaties – but about whether it is really the purpose of such a sub-letting situation that, in the rent we are paying to the city of Strasbourg, we are giving a direct subsidy – for that is exactly what it would be – to the city's budget.
I think that initialling the Interim Trade Agreement between the European Community and Turkmenistan, and at the same time clearly stating the condition of a time limit of five years for the introduction of democratic principles and of human rights standards similar to those of the EU, will provide motivation and will be a sign of good will on the part of the Community.
The new group, like its predecessor, is consultative, independent, multidisciplinary and multinational.
The serious crisis that the sector is currently experiencing would justify the allocation of more funds to help producers overcome the difficulties they are currently facing.
Fortunately no one was injured.
In these circumstances, the Commission also presented a second proposal to prolong the existing voluntary arrangements provided for under Regulation (EC) No 820/97.
Six months ago, the European Parliament acted as a defender of fundamental rights by rejecting the agreement between the EU and the US concerning the transfer and processing of banking data - the so-called 'SWIFT' agreement.
Whilst there are exceptions for the so-called sensitive Member States - the UK, Sweden and Ireland for five years - in the other 12 EU countries proof of a valid rabies vaccination in the form of a passport document will be the only requirement for taking cats, dogs and ferrets between Member States as long as they also have an electronic microchip for identification, although some Member States may continue to use tattoos for an eight-year transition period.
There are many areas where action really needs to be taken by Member States.
It is a fundamental responsibility for us all.
One agreement has been reached on how much capacity is to be reduced.
The Conference of Presidents can only propose a decision to Parliament.
The European Union is a community of values.
Nevertheless, the cooperation framework still has a long way to go: we could say from Barcelona to Barcelona and looking beyond.
I stand by my interpretation.
Most national railway systems in the Member States have comprehensive rules governing the aforementioned social aspects and rather than lose them in the process of liberalisation at European level, we must harmonise them at the highest possible level.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Within the framework of Agenda 2000 we would wish to see proposals for a fair and realistic farming policy, and one that would help to halt the desertion of the countryside.
Urgent changes are needed in this respect; but on the whole we agree with Mr Schulz's report.
That, in practice, appears to be an empty shell.
This is also why we support the principle of a tax on kerosene.
Again, I would like to stress that we support the aims of the Council's framework decision.
On the other hand, new Member States are obliged, on their accession, to sign and ratify the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities covering minority matters.
The United Nations have approved it unanimously.
Secondly, the new Structural Fund regulations have been in force since 1994: in other words, they only recently came into full effect, after a difficult period of approval.
Secondly, it makes little sense to reduce world trade to the concept of fair; the two concepts of fair and socially balanced need to go hand-in-hand.
I cannot quite see from the report, - and I am referring primarily to the report by Mr. W.G. van Velzen, - that a common prefix within the EU will automatically result in lower costs and better service.
Because FIFΑ may consider that forced prostitution is bad advertising for these football matches.
It is responsible for about 70% of all greenhouse gases in cities.
We have met plenty of people in the corridors, including MEPs and Ministers, of whom we had the feeling that they were insufficiently informed of the EU position on agriculture.
The Taliban are murdering their own people, the Allies are there supporting the local population.
The Council, on the other hand, has missed the deadlines set by the Tampere, Laeken, Seville and Thessaloniki European Councils and, five years on, we still await its decisions.
Trends in the machinery and equipment production sector changed dramatically in the EU in Q4 2008 in both Denmark and Germany, where falls in production in excess of 25% were seen.
4. It demands full traceability of medicinal products and, at the same time, establishes an early warning system in all the Member States, so that medicinal products which are suspected of being dangerous can be withdrawn.
The Commission, however, has no wish to adjust the decisions taken at the 2007 summit to the real problems now emerging.
I should also like to draw attention to the fact that new technology should actually make good reporting simpler and quicker so that we do not have to wait two and a half years to be clear about the situation.
The need for professional qualifications acquired in individual Member States to be seen as equivalent also cut clear across the political divide.
It is capable of coming to grips with cigarette smuggling; it has recently turned its attention to the Central and Eastern European countries, and to the PHARE and TACIS programmes, among others.
This consultation aims at gathering stakeholders' views on the need for such a statute and its possible content.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe was founded on the conviction that it was no longer possible to guarantee well-being, freedom, democracy and peace on the basis of national sovereignty.
It was extremely difficult to bring the negotiations to a conclusion at all.
Parliament would have to think very seriously about going to the Court of Justice if our democratic rights were disregarded.
I will certainly benefit from this discussion as we have our General Affairs Council meeting on 28 and 29 October.
I have one reservation, though.
If we only talk about consumer rights in this context, then we should not forget to mention that rights also involve duties.
After the reunification of Germany, we are now on the threshold of further enlargement, and we have an historic opportunity to ensure that we become more than just an extended trade zone.
Some Member States have done this, but most have not or have not done so yet, with distortions of competition as a result.
When every other problem is solved it is crucial for our common future.
However, what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations.
Our resolution calls for the suspension of all non-humanitarian aid to Cambodia and for the European Commission to refuse to deal with Hun Sen's government.
I call on you to support us in this undertaking and to sign this text as soon as possible.
Making a decision quickly will allow us to have a usable and uniform ruling by the autumn, which is in the interests of the Member States and, above all, of breeders and farmers.
Clearly, a greater sense of priorities will be required.
In my opinion, completely the opposite is the case.
Furthermore, the Presidency intends to promote a comprehensive approach with regard to the new, integrated industrial policy, in the framework of which we endeavour to eliminate all informational, financial and technical support barriers that prevent SMEs from becoming the true backbone of the green economy.
(ES) Mr President, we are clearly in a serious situation that calls for all of us to be responsible.
Indeed, it seems fundamental to me that the Member States should guarantee social protection for self-employed women and assisting spouses and that this protection should be equivalent to that of salaried women.
What progress has the President made with this request?
Support for this programme must be increased.
That is why, Commissioner, anyone wishing to help Turkey should ultimately listen to what is being said by the Turkish Cypriots, who are currently protesting, not for direct trade or for its translation, as we heard today in the decision dated 26 April, but for Cyprus to be released from the occupation and for them personally to be released and rescued.
Even the Nordic governments have supported a change for the worse that has now resulted in Member States not even needing to give reasons why they do not want the Commission to pass on documents that they themselves have given to the Commission.
"Cooperation" has been the mostly commonly used word.
This reflects the fact that it is and will remain an important priority for the European Union with regard to our overall relations with that country.
So if the document was valid to be registered in a hotel, in a Nordic state, it will go on being valid for the same purpose.
I wish to draw the House's attention to reports which have appeared in the Belgian, German and UK newspapers this weekend which relate to quite serious allegations that the European Parliament and also Members of the Commission may have been misled in relation to elements of the evidence in the Andreasen affair.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, modern biotechnology offers us great opportunities.
They are based in Europe.
Lastly, as we pointed out previously, we need more investment in urban centres.
Measures included in the Commission's recent energy and climate package will give a further boost to biogas production in the coming years.
They are looking to Europe to help them rediscover their future and to boost employment and business, based around new and more sustainable approaches to development.
Amendment No 10 concerns Article 5. The Commission supports the objectives mentioned here, proof of which is to be seen in the fact that they are implicitly contained in Article 1, which concerns the operational model for European agriculture.
The European Parliament’s views cannot just be sidelined, leaving us to work on implementing the Treaty precisely as it stands.
Regulations cannot be effective if we are unaware of them or are not prepared to follow them.
The second issue has to do with OLAF, and gave rise to much controversy as to how members should be treated by OLAF or should act in regard to it.
Secondly, if greater efficiency is to be achieved by freeing up the movement of the beet quota, what are your intentions for the milk quota?
In this respect, I am also very grateful for the donors' conferences.
We have virtually abandoned the Stability and Growth Pact; we have begun a predictable and wholescale retreat from the Services Directive; we voted in this House to end the opt-out on the Working Time Directive, and meanwhile the Commission is preparing to unveil another 900 new directives: more red tape, more bureaucracy, more interference in the lives of our citizens.
Being different cannot be understood as being worse and therefore all citizens of the European Union should have the same right to a dignified life and equal opportunities for career development.
How wonderful it would be, Madam President, if we could find a solution to prevent conflicts!
As regards the Commission's proposal concerning regional aid, I find it both unacceptable and ridiculous.
If only you had a different policy, based on a different philosophy, based on the philosophy of life, on the belief that life is beautiful, that tomorrow brings with it our future, and that there are more things to life than just this! Instead, because we make cuts and add restrictions, we have ended up with the current situation.
B5-0412/2002, by Mr Hernández Mollar, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on homosexuals in Egypt;
I must point out, especially as I went along with Jean-Louis Bourlanges, that it all had to do with the modus vivendi , and the modus vivendi is also an interesting point sometimes. It has helped us make progress, but actually it has rarely been applied, and then badly.
Although there are contradictions in Community policy, the Member States must take up all available opportunities under the CAP, the CFP, cohesion and structural funds, LIFE+ and the Seventh Framework Programme to support biodiversity targets.
I am put in an optimistic frame of mind when I note that neither political camp has lost sight of the road that leads to Europe and that that is something on which they agree.
This refusal to examine a proposal enabling the Member States to make real economies in 1998 illustrates perfectly the scant interest which the European Parliament takes in States' interests and those of taxpayers in our different countries.
The most fundamental of these is the long-term and wide-ranging exploitation of developing countries by a number of world powers, including European countries.
While respecting state prerogatives, I believe there is a need not only to formulate a minimum standard of protection for self-employed women-mothers, as well as for assisting spouses and recognised life partners, but also to make their degree of protection equal to that of women-mothers who are employed, as opposed to self-employed.
The European Union's involvement in the Democratic Republic of Congo reflects the comprehensive nature of these European ambitions: the main basis for relations between the European Union and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and thus also for EU assistance to stabilise the country, is formed in the first instance by the Cotonou Agreement and the funds available from the European Development Fund in this connection.
We find it contradictory to say that fighting poverty is our priority and, yet we lack the information and indicators necessary to ascertain to what extent the most impoverished sectors have benefited from the aid.
   Mr President, it is a European paradox that while we have a high level of basic research, we have a relatively low level of innovation.
Under the pretext of budgetary rigour, the MEPs were thus asked to vote on an ill-assorted series of proposals whose sole aim is to discredit fellow Members elected by the House to manage Parliament's budget.
I would like to point out the importance of not postponing the introduction of the rotation system until the number of members of the Management Board reaches 18 and making sure that it is implemented as soon as possible in view of both the preparations that Slovakia must carry out in order to join the euro area and the further expansion of the latter.
We have several major programmes that can help in vocational and information and communication terms to identify possible solutions.
The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities.
Now to Amendment No 20. The reason why the Commission has not provided for consultation of Parliament as an absolute condition in article 12, is that the Council of Ministers must be able to react quickly in cases of mass flight.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras on his excellent report, and point out that the Joint Research Centres at which decommissioning of installations and management of nuclear waste are planned, in particular the Ispra centre, are located in densely populated areas, and the environmental characteristics and quality of life of these areas must not be jeopardised in any way.
(Applause)
The Tibetan people live in unique circumstances imposed by nature and have always been somewhat isolated from the surrounding world.
The return of independent dailies is a step forward for public access to information, but the situation is still very fragile.
At the same time, demand for highly qualified people is projected to rise by almost 16 million and demand for people with medium-level qualifications by more than 3.5 million.
Of course, other problems remain to be solved, and these are clearly laid out in the road map.
These relocations are based on competition between populations, and they speculate on social and wage differentials.
Obviously I expect her to take legal action and, if she does not, one can only draw the appropriate conclusions.
So I say that the economic basis of this Auto/Oil study is clearly geared to and principally serves the interests of the industrialists.
However, whereas we have directives for the other two objectives, clearly setting out how the target will be achieved, we have no such instrument for energy efficiency.
They have also opened up new opportunities for local communities and the voluntary sector to engage in projects.
Not collective habits but the effects on the individual must be the overriding factor in our judgement.
For this reason, establishing general rules for trade and the importation of fishery products originating from Greenland cannot be left entirely to the Commission and the Council because this would contradict the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Secondly, the project will have to be technically and financially indivisible.
There is a world of difference between qualified majority and disqualified unanimity.
Reintroducing vaccination, especially since we now have detection tests that are capable of distinguishing serologically between viral infection and immunological response to the vaccine, is the correct solution.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a status solution is the best option for Kosovo and for that reason we should support the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ahtisaari to find one, using all possible means.
Although Member States have already spent significant EU and national resources on creating jobs for long-term unemployed Roma people, a coherent European-level solution has not been found: Member States faced the situation in different ways and to different degrees.
Mr Monti proposes that subsidies of less than EUR 15 million a year paid to businesses with an annual turnover of less than EUR 40 million should in future be the sole responsibility of the Member States.
It will not have its own funding line, nor will it be possible for the fund to be brought forward from the following year, as is the case with the Solidarity Fund.
The rapporteur is also right, therefore, in identifying the problem of classifying individuals and the advisability of only introducing streaming at lower secondary level and of extending the period spent in school-based education.
Mr President, in principle, we welcome any attempt to improve conditions in Turkey and bring the country closer to the European Union.
Now if there is any area in which naive idealism often turns out to be disastrous, it is in foreign policy.
It is a very simple idea to pool and share, but it is very powerful.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 21 documentary references, 21 explanatory comments and 63 points summarising Parliament's requests in the motion for a resolution, making a total of 105 points.
It must be borne in mind that the textiles and clothing industry is of major strategic importance to the EU with great prospects for the future, and that it can make a major contribution towards promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion.
Article 28c paragraph 3 contains the much-criticised mutual aid and assistance obligation to be implemented via a European Defence Agency (Article 28).
I will pull out all the stops for this, and we have all day tomorrow as well.
I believe that this should have been part of the resolution.
The problems of Malta and of Lampedusa are European Union problems.
In this context, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the European Socialist Party support and welcome the correct and timely initiative of President Simitis: we must do everything possible to find a common position and overcome the disagreements within the Council and also with the candidate countries, who are already members of our Union.
(RO) In order to bring about economic recovery in Europe, investments need to be made in new information and communications technologies as a means of stimulating economic growth.
Unfortunately, he will not dare to do so because he knows that the Russian response would be to remind him, as Mr Putin did, of the ongoing conflict in the Basque country.
That is why I am pleased to have been part of the majority of Members who supported the adoption of the previously mentioned resolution.
The EU pressed Russia to confirm expectations of early Russian ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and to commit itself to conclude a long-delayed agreement on the clean-up of nuclear waste in north-west Russia, the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme in the Russian Federation (MNEPR).
Therefore, I do not agree that my British constituent convicted there in his absence should have that conviction automatically recognised in the UK.
Will the British electorate know about this at the time of the British general election, probably in May?
The Court of Auditors judged that the Centre's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular. I welcome the Centre's initiative to run a computerised network for the collection and exchange of information called the European information network on Drugs and Drug Addiction.
However I abstained in the vote because of the report's adherence to the flawed Lisbon Strategy, emphasis on competitiveness, support for flexicurity and the implicit threat to pension schemes, public health and long-term care under the guise of 'structural reform'.
What we now need is a success story. However, for any success the principle of pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept) is a necessity.
So, why do we not try?
We have said that there is a need for humanitarian aid and reconstruction assistance, where we will be looking to Parliament for support.
It ought to be a given that men and women of equal calibre with the same qualifications and in the same position should receive the same pay.
(Applause from the ELDR Group)
   . We voted against the Daul report on the 3% reduction in the tobacco harvest premium in order to fund the Community Tobacco Fund, because this retention will reduce even further the already miserly incomes of the poor tobacco producers, especially in Greece, in order to promote research into how tobacco farmers can diversify into other crops or professions.
It created a certain amount of alarm at the beginning of its spread, which led several Member States to make substantial investments in vaccination programmes that turned out to be excessive, because in countries such as Poland, which did not take any exceptional measures, the mortality rate remained at the level of those countries that embarked on national vaccination campaigns, with costs estimated at many millions of euro.
A central issue in this report, however, as in many others, is monitoring.
Let us hope that by the implementation of these measures we will make it almost impossible - as impossible as travel by sea can allow - for any repetition of such tragedies to take place.
in writing. - Russia blocked gas supplies at an extremely inopportune time for European consumers and it is essential that the gas deliveries are restored without further ado.
Although the Vice-President/High Representative has made excellent senior appointments - I have seen some of these before the Committee on Foreign Affairs - I must ask why she has been short-changed in a stitch-up by the Commission, which seems to have retained a disproportionate amount of resources for EU enlargement and the European Neighbourhood Policy.
At the conference last year on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the European Union maintained the importance of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, also known as the ABM Treaty, as one of the pillars of strategic stability. The European Union also emphasised that it wants to keep this treaty.
But then one arm of the budgetary authority, namely the Council, postponed the date for reaching a decision, through a trialogue or conciliation procedure, until September.
However, in this context, where the Commission, along with a certain number of Members of this Parliament, hopes for further advances, I do not see how we could miss out on the development of biotechnology.
I realise there is a heavy agenda, but I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words.
If postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way, more post offices will be closed, in the name of this infamous profitability, which is often the cause of rural regression.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 25 March 2009.
We gave financial aid to those countries most severely affected by the influx of exiles and refugees.
The series of fatal accidents that have occurred recently has once again highlighted the exploitation of drivers, who are often forced to drive to the point of falling asleep.
Competition rules pure and simple.
The European Parliament's position is fully expressed in the joint motion for a resolution, from which I should like to highlight three points: the call for the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank, the call for greater attention to be given to environmental and energy issues, and above all the question of the status of women.
As Commissioner for development, I should like there to be no doubt as to my commitment on this issue.
The problem is not only that we do not know the Mandarin Chinese language, but that they know the English and European languages much better - this is an enormous asymmetry.
At a time like this, when it is becoming necessary to move towards a political Europe, it is increasingly difficult to understand why the European Council continues to meet behind closed doors when acting in its legislative capacity.
If we are to realise the full potential of Europe's maritime interests and to realise the vision of clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas, then we have to implement a management plan that aims for sustainability in every area, and the way to do that is devolve more management responsibility to our regional advisory councils.
The treaties must be simplified. The EU' s tasks and powers must be more clearly defined.
The Heads of State and of Government also took the view that there was no compelling necessity to have a common defence policy at this time and did not include it in this version of the treaty, a decision which I fully endorse.
This text has been streamlined and updated and takes account of the rulings of the Court of Justice, but also of the current realities of employment and of certain types of self-employed workers.
Resolutions, however, are mere words.
In this regard, I should like to give you the following information: in a few days' time, the negotiations on resolving the crisis in Kosovo will resume in France.
These figures speak for themselves and are terrifying.
We really hope and believe so.
So please go ahead and ask the President-in-Office of the Council something else about organised crime.
Lacking a vigorous policy in this field is criminally irresponsible.
Can the Commission say whether it considers that all the legal procedures concerning the drawing-up and approval of the project and the awarding of the construction contract have been respected, what this project consists of exactly and what (sustainable...) development strategy it forms part of, whether the overall assessment of its environmental consequences is positive and, finally, whether its economic profitability is ensured, both at national level and as regards the development of the regions concerned?
I very much hope that the House will support those revisions.
When it comes forward with that proposal we can consider what the ethical committee's terms of reference shall be and who shall be on it.
I must particularly highlight the role of Vice-President Frattini.
The problems of competitiveness are not unique to any one country: all Member States are facing the same challenges.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard today more than once, it is important and a matter of urgent necessity that we should make every effort in order to boost Europe's attractiveness as a knowledge base and thereby draw closer to the Lisbon objectives.
The only things we see and hear from you are diplomatic circumlocutions of no importance, which merely prepare the way for the convocation of the EU - Turkey Council of Association.
More and more cars mean that, despite fuel-saving technologies, CO2 emissions are increasing.
Neither the US nor China is larger, contrary to what is usually stated in discussions on what is and what will be the number one global economy.
Changing circumstances within the European Union, new forms of criminal activity and new terrorist threats mean that the existing body is in need of reorganisation.
It is also difficult to understand why the Joint Readmission Committee is not authorised to monitor compliance with human rights and why individuals seeking political asylum are covered by the Agreement.
In the light of the slow growth experienced in recent years, it is essential to increase investment in infrastructures and research, development and innovation.
She had daily contact with her two sons. She went home for parents' evenings arranged at the school attended by her boys.
The second reason why this amendment is not acceptable to the Commission is that the UCITS Contact Committee's mandate was discussed by Parliament at first reading.
His statement gives credence to our fears about the creation of a European arms industry.
In this case there is no shared block, each country controls its territorial area and that is that.
It is not enough for foreign nationals wanting to enter and remain in the ΕU for no more than three months to be in possession of the necessary documents, to convince the authorities that they have legitimate reasons and enough money to survive for that period and to give detailed information on where and how they will live; they must also not be nationals 'for whom an alert has been issued in the Schengen Information System' and must not be considered 'a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or the international relations of any of the Member States'.
That is why we are going to vote for an amendment rejecting the motion which we, the French Socialist delegation, have tabled together with the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Belgian Socialist delegation.
I voted in favour of adopting the 2009 progress report on Croatia.
Nothing else will satisfy the public demand for more certainty and confidence.
As the President said, we must not only observe events but act with far more determination to achieve at least the minimum objective of avoiding the present serious risk of civil war and the breakup of Albania.
Transatlantic commercial services and revision flows amount to USD 3 billion a day.
We should bear in mind that this is always the surest and fastest method of cooperation: science, educational institutions and students.
Mr President, Commissioner, first I would like to welcome this joint motion for a resolution and stress our joint condemnation of the new wave of violence in Guinea-Bissau and our demand for full implementation of the cease-fire agreed on 3 February.
(B5-0229/2002) by Mrs Boudjenah and Mr Miranda, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the Channel Tunnel and the refugees at Sangatte;
There is no safety programme in place.
I want to talk about something else.
We need to be more sensitive to the territorial and urban dimension of EU policies.
Do we have an underlying plan?
Commissioner, you are aware that proportionately speaking, one thousand people in Malta are equivalent to two hundred thousand in Germany, two hundred already at the beginning of the summer.
Research shows that each year 140 000 species disappear from the Earth.
As far as the current Tempus III programme is concerned, I believe it is especially important that the greatest of care should be taken to match the various priorities very closely with the national needs of the target countries.
He is not here today.
I thought you were asking a question on the general procedure, which I tried to clarify.
Rather than resentful words condemning patriotism, we need intelligent action in favour of Europeanism.
We find this practice alarming - it is a current practice in Brussels, according to which the Treaty is put in the cupboard as soon as the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament agree not to apply it.
Let us move on, though, to the subject of solidarity.
Passivity on this issue, and pretence that the problem will solve itself is, in the words of Talleyrand, worse than a crime, it is a blunder.
Those people who maintain this position are naturally expressing an initial negotiating position because, otherwise, we would have to assume they have their heads in the clouds.
If we all want peace, if we are against bloodthirsty tyrants, if we are in favour of an active policy of destroying weapons of mass destruction, we must be able, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to unite ourselves once again, and what my group respectfully asks is that you deliver this message, this demand, supported by millions of our fellow European citizens, so that the European Council speaks clearly, and so that we are capable of uniting and also of seriously relaunching the Middle East peace process - which is absolutely essential - and ensuring our future as a strong, consolidated and capable European Union in our own eyes and in the eyes of the world.
Such has also been the case through most of the Union's history, and it has been shown time and time again that it is difficult to change this state of affairs.
Without it, there will never be an economic recovery; the banks will not starting lending money again, and so on.
The government has already officially invited the EU to carry out an observation mission.
The White Paper is about preparing the central and eastern European countries for their integration into the Union's internal market.
That is why the European Union needs its second public health programme: because we must jointly defend ourselves against the health risks which have appeared so dramatically, with the possibility of a 'flu pandemic and with the bird 'flu epidemic, and that is one of the aims of the programme.
While these issues are obviously linked to the subject of the Green Paper and highly important in their own right, they were left out of the Green Paper, as they were covered in other Commission documents elaborated in parallel.
For example, Belgium and the Netherlands seem to pay a great deal because there are customs duties on imports through Antwerp and Rotterdam.
This directive builds on existing Community texts and incorporates into Community law the revised 40 recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on money laundering and terrorist financing.
So, with these proposals the Commission found itself in the situation of seeking to establish an appropriate balance between the interests of those supplying the commercial statistics on the one hand, and the users of the statistics on the other.
They do not think there would be a market for drugs for rare diseases, so they do not conduct the research.
Although the von Boetticher report limits the agency’s tasks for the time being, it cannot therefore give us any reassurance.
I consider it highly significant that the liberalisation of the visa regime for citizens of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina will mean that almost all residents of the former Yugoslavia can enjoy visa-free travel in the European Union.
The responses we received at that time were not the most appropriate.
The ability to feed themselves plays a major role in this context.
It therefore follows that the budgetary authority will be informed of new appointments.
In my opinion, the most problematic issue is the enforceability of legislation and of contractual obligations.
Finally, the information contained in Article 3 must be communicated and addressed personally to the consumer.
Finally, while the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact has delivered the expected results, the picture is more mixed regarding the preventative arm.
Mr President, first, flowers for Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos, mental and verbal flowers for a well executed piece of work.
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually, even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects.
We call on the people to step up their fight to stop their self-proclaimed saviours trampling on the rights for which they have fought hard and made sacrifices, and to reverse the current trend, which only serves the interests of those who are exploiting them.
Shamil Basayev, who planned and authorised the attack, is not a leader of the Chechen independence movement, he is a murderer of children, an inhuman terrorist who has littered Russian soil with innocent bodies.
Besides, it is in their interest.
We clearly do not need it.
The request must be completed according to a specific form and contain specific information: the name and address of the parties to the proceedings, the nature and the matter of the particular case and a description of the evidence to be supplied.
It means clearing up entire regions, the repair and construction of homes, and reviving the economy.
Madam President, we all acknowledge the terrorist threat and we must go on reacting to it, without betraying who and what we are.
(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)
My second point is that I would like to congratulate the Commission.
I do not need to remind you that we have to find a solution quickly, especially due to the Visa Code which will be applicable from 5 April this year and will abolish the so-called D+C visas which were intended to partly remedy the situation of D visa holders.
We twice supported the defeat of the Ports Directive but we are not against maritime policy in general.
I am glad that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has already decided to consult interested parties about this.
We also have variety in Europe.
This chance is now already small enough, particularly in those countries which will not be permitted to join the single currency.
We will say that the drive for ever lower prices can prejudice fair treatment for people at work.
Mr President, active abstention means no more and no less than that we are not washing our hands of the agreement with Mexico, that we want an agreement, but we want a good one.
Mr President, I am speaking to propose that this Parliament express its condemnation and rejection of the farcical presidential elections which took place in Equatorial Guinea.
I can also agree with the idea of setting a target fishing mortality rate for Bay of Biscay sole, as in Amendment 15.
Yet it is not to the credit of the President of the Commission that he has once again entrusted such sensitive tasks to someone from the same government, which is the least credible of all the European governments in terms of justice and the defence of freedoms.
Mr President, I want to say a word on the need to include CO2 emissions in the Eurovignette.
We all know that what we have here is unfinished business.
Indeed, regulatory convergence can do much to promote fair competition, particularly with regard to state subsidies, social and environmental standards.
Yes, social rights are mentioned, but they should be clearly and practically defined: the right to work, the right to health, the right to education, the right to housing, to a pension, the right, that is, to life, to a life where all have equal opportunities, according to those principles of liberté [freedom] and égalité [equality] which have played such a major part in our extensive history.
Today I should like to address my comments to those Members of this House who have taken a critical approach to the Constitution.
But, on the other hand, current development makes it clear that parts of the Berlin Agreement were not quite so prudent and forward-looking and that there is a need here for further improvement.
His style of left-wing rule is reminiscent of the worst communist governments of eastern and central Europe in the period before the fall of the Berlin Wall.
The directive on the air traffic controllers’ licence is a significant step towards the realisation of our great goal of a single European sky.
Unfortunately, we have no brave and visionary Commission President.
I am also proud that we from Parliament have secured three crucial changes to the new rules.
However, I have several reservations to add to the somewhat rosy-coloured picture painted by the Commission with regard to the relationship between cohesion and the so-called information society, especially because, in a context in which state responsibility is declining, owing to the privatization of companies and services which at the outset might be in a better position to deal with the problems that might affect the less developed regions, it is difficult to see how the prospect of a large and easy profit is compatible with the universality and fairness of citizens' rights and the objects of inter-regional and inter-State cohesion within our Union.
This is a totally different matter to the issue of comparative trials that we are discussing here today.
It was an Englishman, Ricardo, who explained the laws of international trade and its comparative advantages to us.
Like traditional TV, digital TV can be broadcast across terrestrial networks, by cable and via satellite.
In terms of traditional cooperation, the financial resources that we have at our disposal are disproportionately low compared to the problem we are debating.
It is therefore the duty of the European Parliament to ask the Council and the Commission to follow the political situation in this country closely and to encourage the president with resoluteness in this very unstable period of transition to clearly commit himself to a return of the democratic order in this country.
If certain amendments calling for stricter provisions are accepted, then we can kiss biotechnology in the area of plants goodbye and we can totally ban it right away, but that is not what we want to do.
Could we please have less regulation; better regulation; simpler regulation; thoroughly vetted regulation; risk-assessed regulation.
This is a major achievement and I would urge you to make rapid steps to continue in the same vein.
I have read Monnet’s memoirs with great pleasure, but nowhere found references there in support of the undemocratic, super-centralised EU state heralded by the Constitution.
Over the course of these 30 years, European countries have had to cope with high translation costs and, in some cases, competitive disadvantages on the global market.
Why is it mainly men who are involved in club and association structures, even though more and more women are becoming members?
Under those circumstances, I can only reiterate my warnings.
The statute of the European company does fit in, which means that a framework directive is needed for that.
   Mr President, the proposed directive is intended to ensure that groundwater quality is monitored and evaluated across Europe in a harmonised way.
Let me draw your attention specifically to the codecision rights under the Lisbon Treaty.
We watch our media reporting almost exclusively about the relocation of production, rather than on the creation of new jobs or increased prosperity, both of which we owe to world trade.
Producers or importers should assume responsibility for the recovery and safe disposal of all pesticide packaging and pesticides past their expiry date and revoked pesticides products.
Just last week, the Institute for Strategic Studies in London said that Europeans were not in a position to act.
Politicians and adventurers who wish to set peoples against each other still have plenty of scope.
It must take the lead in the global agenda.
Work on anti-discrimination has come to a standstill.
Mr President, Mr Savary' s reports raise a matter of crucial importance to European railways.
We will, by that point, have much higher levels of animal health and animal welfare across the EU.
Madam President, I would like to ask for your help.
This is, I think, an important point.
This attack was not, of course, against the Taliban; it was against 500 civilians.
Unless I am mistaken, however - and would that I were - a David Bowie hit seems to have mysteriously become their theme tune.
Instead, a completely different procedure has been followed.
We know full well that what you are doing, Commissioner, and that is, limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b.
I would like to remind him that we reached agreement on a Directive on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments.
It does not give us freedom of information, but merely freer information.
To achieve this, we have to use the means available to us - the Association Agreement and certainly the Customs Union too.
The concern of the political representatives of EU capital is to secure a larger share in the distribution of the region's imperialist loot; they, therefore, stress that 'the EU should encourage and help European investors to be involved in rebuilding Afghanistan.'
That is much more important than a direct means of creating jobs.
(Applause)
We want to go all out for a high level of consumer protection, and want attention to the smallest, most vulnerable consumers - children - to remain high on the agenda.
A crisis-simulation exercise took place in 2006. As a follow-up to that exercise, the Council will reflect in 2007 on how better to address cross-border crisis situations and clarify burden-sharing arrangements.
On that point we have set important targets, both with the six priorities and with the priorities of the European Parliament for the 2001 budget.
The European Union has a choice of how to react to events in its neighbourhood: it can just make a statement or get actively involved in the peaceful settlement of this conflict.
Obviously, amendments to the legal framework are also beginning to have an impact.
The fact is that as we go into the twenty-first century, we need to set about extending the traditional 18th- and 19thcentury concept of civil human rights to include a number of basic rights which are of fundamental importance to people in Europe and throughout the world.
In fact, there is no such thing as beneficial incineration and harmful discharges.
It should also be stressed that Parliament' s rapid approval of this directive without any further amendments was made possible thanks to the excellent cooperation between the rapporteur, the Finnish Presidency and the European Commission.
However, as has already been said, several European countries have announced drastic cuts.
We are working closely and intensively together with all euro area Member States and the ECB in order to reach such a solution this week in the context of the European Council.
I, personally, am in talks with our colleagues, who are here in the gallery, and my feeling is that we should talk about everything.
Secondly, we say that future scoreboards should include subsidies in the accession countries.
Otherwise we are going to have huge problems.
Last Saturday was 8 March - International Women's Day - and so I thought it fitting to say something about that here, too.
I will never tire of fighting for equality for the smallest, the poorest and the defenceless.
That is a crucially important objective where we all agree.
The report of the European Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee covers the necessary powers.
The atrocities to which the resolution refers, including the general lawlessness and frequent rape of women are all connected with this chaos.
The debate is closed.
With the single market and the application of the Treaty of Maastricht, the integrationist logic of the construction of Europe has been strengthened in the overseas departments.
Investor confidence is crucial for the successful development of our financial services markets.
We must take advantage of each country's term of office to explain properly the nature of the different institutions and bring them home to the public, because that is the time when each country is best able to influence public opinion.
The promise by the German government and by other European countries to write off the debts of the poorest countries in the world will help considerably, because the high level of debt is an obstacle to investments in all forms of infrastructure in the countries in question and is hence one of the biggest obstacles in the fight against poverty.
Europe must act as a pioneer and take charge of realistic, necessary measures on an international basis.
The COM in wine would eventually become a COM in property.
A committee on European information was proposed by the rapporteur as a kind of executive of the communication policy.
The Commission supports the basic thrust of the report.
I feel embarrassed at all the criticism, censure, sarcasm and derision levelled at my country for what has, I regret to say, quite rightly been called the Italian anomaly, or the serious conflict of interests that involves our Prime Minister.
Like many of you, I believe that it is now towards developing countries that we should direct our efforts to convince and our ability to form alliances.
This must be your absolute priority.
In this context, Croatia has presented an action plan.
I believe that one of the neglected parts of the Lisbon agenda is greater social cohesion, which the IDA Programme will contribute to greatly, as well as, of course, the knowledge-based economy.
For this reason, the view of many Member States that consider that almost all of the regulation concerning the rights of the child belongs in the jurisdiction of family law, and therefore, almost by definition, is exclusively a national responsibility, is very worrying.
Firstly, because complementarity enables us to take advantage of the synergy resulting from a coordinated approach in the actions to be implemented, not only by the European Union but also by all the international donors, which will improve the impact of those actions.
We need firmly agreed deadlines, and all those people who are involved in the expansion and coordination of the electronic data-processing system could help here.
The best strategy for amending, for changing international legislation is to pass a specific European law.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for the fact that here in Parliament we are striving to safeguard Europe's cultural heritage.
Why do we need this Treaty?
On the contrary.
So we will be left with an even more severe monetaristic logic, calling into question European civilization as such.
An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in various countries, particularly China and India, often to the detriment of countries that respect workers' rights.
Firstly, the risk of pandemics should not be exaggerated.
Of course, this again boils down to Dutch taxpayers having to dig deeply into their pockets once again.
The problem is finding the right methods to do so.
They went to stock up with emergency goods.
Directives do not prevent natural cannibalism in animals.
I would raise two points with the rapporteur.
The Commission regrets that the constructive dialogue which was started at the time of the troika mission to Kinshasa and continued at the meeting with the foreign affairs minister, Mr Karaha, in Brussels, has not been followed by results.
On 26th September this year the main leaders, the representatives of the Front for the Restoration of Unity in Djibouti, or FRUD, were arrested by Afar, the opposition group, this including FRUD representatives who are active here in Europe.
At regional level, the EU and its Member States cooperate, in the framework of the Barcelona Convention, with Mediterranean partner countries to promote the prevention of pollution, and improve the response to it, in all the regional seas bordering the Union.
The sanctions which have been in place for 10 years have clearly not achieved their desired objectives.
I do feel somewhat uneasy, however, that the Committee on Legal Affairs, which is responsible for the mandate of Members, could not be consulted on this text.
Detailed information has been printed in the press, including Göteborgsposten, suggesting that US security services have been highly active in preparations for the Summit.
That is why adopting stricter legislation and more vigorous measures while there is still time is an issue and a responsibility we must all assume.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution as the general idea of cost efficiency in the EU is brought up.
A series of availability problem have arisen, compromising animals health and welfare across species.
I hope the Commission will appreciate the willingness and commitment of the new regional government and will soon see fit to release the European funding intended for this region so as to encourage its growth, subject of course to proper, rigorous controls and compliance with EU legislation.
We ought to think about this in connection with the forthcoming Financial Perspective.
Indeed, beyond the approaches or values everyone has, I believe it important to say in concrete terms that the situation of the herring stock in the Baltic Sea is good.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Moreover, there are other programmes working in the Community's transfrontier area, such as INTERREG, which might obviously also apply here.
Your Majesty, our institution is well aware of your personal work and your commitment to the least-favoured social classes.
Therefore, in that sense, this was remarkably fast and, once again, I want to thank all the people who were involved in this, because it shows that the machinery works.
We need to focus on the objective: more employment and more jobs in Europe.
Therefore, I wish to put on record now what I was trying to propose.
The financing of the programmes has caused worry to the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and it might not be just a one-off problem.
It is going to require a good understanding of Russia.
On the business in hand: more would have been better.
It is a very delicate compromise and to break it would create serious problems, as Mr Watts said a moment ago.
First of all, as asked by various speakers, why did we have problems with the Pact?
The polling stations, usually in schools and administered by teachers, were efficient and well organised.
We should not abandon that principle.
It is important that we also define this new role of Europe in the world.
The USA cannot be expected to carry this burden with less and less contribution from us.
I am absolutely convinced that this is an area in which there is considerable scope for us to provide greater growth and in which, above all, we can provide jobs in regions of Europe where there are no practical alternatives, where only tourism can provide really good jobs.
Confidence of the markets is not enough.
On reflection I think we could have spent more time on that had we been allowed to do so.
We all agree, yes, that we should not eat clones, but we all know that nobody is going to eat clones.
What we see in the case of many projects - and Commissioner Kinnock has already submitted proposals in this respect and set up his own group of experts - is that, in actual practice, a private-public partnership really only works in the case of a few such projects if nothing is also done to increase public investment.
This is the general service model I also support for the Europe we are in the process of creating.
Those who believe that the committee will solve the problem of unemployment in the EU are wrong.
It is therefore my view that the Commission would have been well-advised to follow our thinking, which is that of the rapporteur and of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and, in the final analysis, give these measures the legal basis of the protection of the Community's financial interests.
If we were to adopt the proposal of Amendment No 35 by Mr Cappato to change e-mail services of this kind, the entire computer system would need to be changed. Indeed, we would then need to change over from the POP 3 system, which nearly everyone in Europe has, to the e-map system which is offered by only one American provider.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, if I may begin with the last point, namely the transposition period, let me say that this directive sets a precedent.
I should like to point out that it was Germany that got the ball rolling, and I am pleased that we have now reached a satisfactory result.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
Every act of violence, whether in southern Serbia or in Mitrovica, disrupts the painstaking peace process that is currently taking place in the Balkans.
Report (A5-0165/2001) by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission's recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community in 2001 (COM(2001) 224 - C5-0169/2001 - 2001/2081(COS))
Commercial and industrial cloning, or cloning in order to create people with certain characteristics is unacceptable in everyone' s book, and rightly so.
The list of things that so many women, young girls and children are forced to undergo was pitiable, as were the details of these things.
Let me conclude by saying that we have to bear in mind that competitiveness and multifunctionality must, again and again, be subjected to scrutiny and assessed, and that due regard must be paid to development.
But Öcalan's PKK, as it is seen and perceived today, with the role and power it has today, would certainly not have been conceivable were it not for the present internal situation in our partner state, Turkey, which lives in constant fear of its territorial integrity being put at risk.
If you really do want to do no more than extend the working life of superannuated technology, then you are increasing the risks inherent in energy production rather than delivering us from them.
This is the state of affairs after the programme has been in action for more than a year!
There cannot, of course, be effective control without transparent procedures and without democratic scrutiny by Parliament.
The strategic partnership, which was reaffirmed in early September in New Delhi, also contains commitments.
Did the European Council devote even five minutes' thought to what we failed to do previously in our policy on the Mediterranean?
Indeed, we must show very much greater determination to apply the Kyoto Protocol.
We need to encourage a culture of learning, curiosity and risk-taking.
The citizen must have the sense that by casting their vote, they can leave their mark on European policy and on the solution to the problems that are crying out for European cooperation, including asylum, food safety and the environment.
Mr President, Mrs Giannakou's report reflects the logical sequence of events over recent years which were aimed at raising citizens' interest in politics in the European Union.
The food industry in Ireland and now in Europe as a whole is reeling under the impact of the foot-and-mouth catastrophe, but it is wrong to demonise any one country for this outbreak.
Mr President, I am deeply insulted that Mrs Harms merely heckled me from off microphone but waved her blue card at my colleague, Mr Reul.
You then have to take into account other ventures - for example, sporting movements, youth groups and others who are also participating in the organization - which will receive 4.3 %.
(RO) Mr President, I believe that there are certain disparities within Romania's agriculture sector in terms of structural problems, compared with other Member States.
The only reason that the problems of securing the other external borders of the EU are not the focus of public attention is that the images are not so concentrated in the media and thus do not make such a powerful impression.
Finally, has the Commission had any reaction - official or otherwise - from the present Iranian regime since the European Foreign Ministers' decision on 26 January 2009?
Mr President, we shall say yes, tomorrow, to the work of the conciliation committee, in the spirit of someone closing a major chapter of that book of dreams entitled 'trans-European routes' .
Why such urgency?
One of the principles of our constitutions is the separation of powers.
Given that Portugal has requested assistance for 839 cases of redundancy at Qimonda S.A., a multinational company which operates in the electronics sector in the NUTS II Norte region, I voted in favour of the resolution, as I agree with the Commission's proposal, combined with the respective amendments introduced by Parliament.
So the Council is making all the necessary efforts to ensure that all those efforts for RTD and innovations in the automotive industry, but also short-term measures in this report, are fully coherent with the overarching goals of the Lisbon Strategy.
in writing. - Consumer credits are an essential pillar of the internal market.
Today, the Council is requesting that the Commission relax the rules on the pretext that, in certain cases, industries cannot prevent a minimal accidental contamination of their products by genetically modified material during transportation or processing.
The European Parliament has arranged its timetable with this objective in mind.
Is there a problem with the English interpretation?
I think that is nothing at all.
Allow me to mention certain other provisions that we will demand are included in the agreement.
We must step up our energy-saving campaigns, along with Europe's citizens.
This revealed that certain adjustments had been made in Member States.
The truth of the matter is that the two aspects of the Lisbon Strategy are incompatible.
Above all, this regulation should provide for requirements to indicate non-textile parts of animal origin when labelling or marking textile products, so that consumers can make a choice on the basis of the information in their possession.
The European Union was able to obtain reaffirmation of the commitments entered into during the Uruguay Round, as we hoped, but those commitments have not been extended, which was the particular aim of those countries that export textile products and agricultural produce.
2) Second, I hope that during ratification Member States will not start to use the treaty as a political tool, as occurred in Slovakia where the opposition, although in favour of the Treaty, made ratification conditional upon the governing party withdrawing a draft law with which the opposition disagreed.
In this regard, too, the Commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on, and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others.
I believe that, for short periods, we require support in that sector.
The Commission, in agreement with the Member States, made it clear at the last summit at Hampton Court that social protection and the protection of workers' rights are an integral part of European values.
It is surprising that, although a number of countries, including the allies of the United States are dictatorships, Iraq, a Muslim country that is secular and tolerant towards religions and minorities - the Deputy Prime Minister is Christian and three government ministers are Kurds - is their number one target.
I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Matikainen-Kallström, because her report points in precisely that direction.
And finally a constant element in the game the European Union plays with its neighbours, especially the nearest ones, as part of the European neighbourhood policy, should be an energy clause following the model of the anti-terrorist clauses which we in this place, the European Parliament, insist are included in agreements with third countries.
We must close this European gap with innovation and not allow ourselves to remain bogged down with education alone.
Logically, in order to be given such a card, the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme.
In the field of demand reduction, preventive measures and programmes for children and young people should, instead of focusing exclusively on illegal drugs, address addiction in general, including aspects of alcohol and tobacco use.
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes
The EU, the said, is the wrong institutional platform from which to deal with globalisation.
This impact assessment is important to us for two reasons.
That is a specific case in which we acted as intermediaries and basically each side saw the other' s point of view, which finally proved the right approach to take.
Are there any comments?
Also, we need to ensure that technologies like ISDN have equal access - in the UK it is very expensive to get access to that.
But the need for reform applies to every institution.
But there is one responsibility that this House cannot evade today, namely its responsibility for enabling the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to switch to alternative energy policies, instead of helping them to pursue the dangerous and senseless upgrading and conversion of their nuclear plants.
I think we should take this opportunity to send out a signal from the House to our neighbours beyond the Union's borders, including the citizens of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, making it clear that the strengthened Union border is certainly not a wall to defend ourselves against them.
Since the individual species are unable to stand up for themselves, we need to do this for them, at home or elsewhere.
Household appliances are certainly improving, that is true, but households are increasing, both in size and number, because families are becoming smaller.
It remains, of course, to be seen whether the new Member States can meet these old standards, never mind the new ones.
I would like to draw attention to a seminar held in our group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and to a book devoted to problems of history and politics which our group is going to publish.
Subject: European Union Solidarity Fund
We are now three part-sessions and three months on. I do not doubt your good intentions but the point is that nothing has been done yet.
I deplore the fact that did not happen, all the more so because this is the first readmission agreement negotiated by the Community.
When the former Foreign Minister of Bosnia and current UN Ambassador can only travel to Banja Luka after three years under the protection of European parliamentarians, how can an ordinary mortal move around freely in that country?
We feel that the market is not a solution to all problems but neither is it the source of all evil.
What is the current situation as regards the legal status of non-Islamic religious communities, particularly Christians, in Turkey, especially with reference to religious freedom, the right to form entities that are empowered to act, building places of worship and parochial centres, and training a new generation of priests?
In the case of Turkey, too, we must give a clear 'yes' or 'no' as it is not possible to pull the wool over Turkey's eyes and to promise possible future membership.
Labelling should not function as a warning sign.
Almost six years have elapsed since Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 was passed. Two and a half years have elapsed since it entered into force.
Finally, I would like to welcome Mr Diamandouros’ commitment, with which he deepened mutual cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and his liaison network.
Women continue to hold mainly lower grade and unskilled jobs and to have limited participation in responsible and senior administrative jobs in economic, social and political life.
I certainly would not give them an 'A' grade for their work.
If absorption capacity is to be based on acceptance of the Constitutional Treaty, then one could have the impression that the authors of this text definitely want to close the door to everyone.
EU businesses trying to trade or invest in South-East Asia still face tariff and non-tariff barriers and markets tilted against foreign service providers, especially in public procurement markets.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
The Spring European Council due to be held in a few days' time will address an issue that intersects with the field of jobs - namely that of energy.
Mr Kirkhope is not here, but let me say that the fight against terrorism is a very important argument.
At this time of economic crisis, we should be trying to ensure that businesses, especially small family businesses, do not incur further expenses against their will.
But in the past the Turks have not had to contend with the European Union.

It is not true to say that, as elected politicians, we automatically have a sufficient knowledge of gender equality and the integration of the gender equality perspective.
In view of a possible compromise with Parliament, which has stressed the need to protect consumers from price increases on standard postal services, and with regard to Amendments Nos 6, 9 and 10, the Commission could agree to widening the proposed scope of postal services that may qualify for a reduced rate so as to include standard postal services relating to items of up to 10 kg in weight.

For this purpose, we support the strengthening of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly's role as the preferred forum for developing such a dialogue.
The debate is closed.
With regard to the strong criticism that has been directed at the Commission proposal on the Soil Protection Directive, prior discussion about the topic would undoubtedly have been helpful, including to calm tempers all round.
There have been passionate and interesting debates in our committee, and it is a shame that Mr Cohn-Bendit has not been able to follow them.
This is all the more shocking, given that this law came about without the Prime Minister even being consulted.
This year, total under-use amounted to EUR 7.4 billion, or EUR 7 400 million, and that is extremely unsatisfactory.

The next thing I would like to mention is that we will start all but one initiative - the Smart Cities, which came later, on your initiative, and which talks predominantly about resource efficiency - during 2010, but do not think that the things we are talking about here are not ongoing already: they are, especially in research.
It makes no sense to put conditions on other people' s votes.

Let me reiterate that the Commission remains committed to maintaining administrative efficiency and, in line with previous commitments, the Commission will not request any new posts.
I know that lorries are allowed to drive around quite happily in Belgium, for example, whereas the same might not be true in neighbouring countries. I ask you, is this what Europe is all about?

I would also like to stress from the outset that, if we want to boost employment in the European Union, it is of fundamental importance to build on the role of small and medium-sized enterprises for, when all is said and done, they are the hard core of our undertaking in Europe. With regard to the reference to the cultural economy and new technologies, this should also be included in the Lisbon report, and my view is that we will be able to use these bases to boost employment substantially.

The problem of sustainability in the broad sense, environmental, naturally, with the grave consequences of the pollution created by transport, which cancel out the savings made in the rest of industry with a view to fulfilling the Kyoto commitments, and with the impact, not only on nature generally, but on the health of the citizens who, according to certain reports, reaches levels practically as serious as transport accident levels.

A majority in this House has rejected the Commission’s proposals for liberalisation – which I would describe as pigheaded – and the Commission is now finding it extremely difficult to come up with new ones, our view having been that public passenger traffic cannot be seen in black and white in the same way as trans-European freight transport or air travel, and that there are special interests involved in it, including regional ones.

I should also like the Commission to tell us what options are afforded us by the democracy and human rights instrument for taking the necessary steps both in our dialogue with Nigeria and in our cooperation with it; as we know, it is not just Chinese businesses that are disregarding human rights and social inequalities, for their Western counterparts have always turned a blind eye to them in the quest for oil.

I know there is resistance, but to shift taxation either to investigations on national level - while we know that, in a kind of prisoner's dilemma, we do not dare move because a competing colleague Member State will carry off the prize - or by passing the mandate on to Ecofin, where ultimately there must be unanimity in decision-making, does not exactly fill me with enthusiasm for the future, especially as I know that if there was one negative factor in the preparations of the summit, it was Ecofin.

On behalf of my group, I would therefore like to support this promotion of a multifunctional agriculture to meet the expectations of our society and underline the adequacy of resources, the conditionality of aids and the strengthening of actions in the second pillar.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you once again for your work.
Terrorism and other forms of organised crime know no boundaries and are also, quite literally, exploiting the benefits of our democratic system.
The main thing is, in my view, to find once more a credible partner, putting an end to this interminable state of transition, and enabling the European executive to resume its onerous duties and finally make progress, in close consultation with the Members of the European Parliament, on the crucial matters of concern to Europe and its citizens.
However, if, for the overwhelming majority of people, access to university or school is dependent on whether their parents have enough money in their wallets, then that is not a social policy.
Communication of Council common positions: see Minutes
Please forgive me for saying so, but this is not satisfactory.
All this has had serious consequences, such as inadequate protection of the Union's financial interests, major distortions of competition and the wide margins offered to organized crime, which has found new opportunities for making big profits.

For solar thermal collectors and systems manufactured in other countries to benefit from public solar energy subsidies in France and Spain, they must be tested for compliance with the respective national standards and verification procedures, despite their having already been certified in accordance with European standards.

These networks must be institutionalised so that their role in the areas in which they develop can be strengthened and they can act as advisors and experts on the councils in their areas.

However, in this Parliament, it is a question, and in my case, a concern which relates to the EU legal system, and consequently an issue that affects the degree to which we share our common values, and to which we share how Europe has been built, by States and by the fundamental texts of the Member States and other national founding texts.
We call for a thorough investigation, within the constitutional and legal framework of East Timor, to identify and try the main perpetrators of these attacks.

I hope that, at the beginning of 2012, when I take my seat in the European Parliament, I will be able to shake hands with fellow Members from Croatia.
The aim of the Commission’s proposal is to increase protection for consumers.

I do not want to attack Mr van den Broek.
That sums up what we are trying to achieve on the e-side, the electronic side, of life.

Commissioner, you mentioned the ongoing evaluation that you will be making over the next two years.

   Mr President, we have asked the competent services to make a linguistic correction because Amendment No 2 has been tabled in English and there are other versions which contain the word ‘considerable’, which does not appear in the English version, which is the true one.

The Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7) is the world's most significant research support programme, which plays a key role in maintaining the competitiveness of Europe and the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy.
Poverty is rising in European Union countries.
Since our shared vision is to see a real European diplomatic service which is not just an extension of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States, the Financial Regulation and Staff Regulations, which we will discuss today and vote on tomorrow, are of paramount importance.
We must hope that you will apply yourselves to this matter instead of bringing the legal base into question.

I think that it is too soon, even from my own group, to come up with very concrete proposals about how this should go.
Mr President, I read this Council of the European Union common position through with great interest.
We do not want to jeopardise that scheme in any way and we now have enough assurances from the Commission that our concerns will be taken into account.

At its extraordinary meeting on SARS, the Council broadly agreed the orientation developed by the Commission with the assistance of the Network Committee.
Also, we must not forget that the European Commission needs to step up its support for small and medium-sized enterprises.

I join others in congratulating the rapporteur for such a wide-ranging report.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to thank everyone for the helpful and constructive way that we have conducted this debate today.
We currently have an immigration policy that is based on manifest hypocrisy and cynicism.
Therefore, our main problem was how to eliminate the excess capacity.
Mr President, I am delighted to make this last speech while you are presiding, and on this subject, as you have also helped us a great deal.
This could provide vital resources and devise incentives for implementation by allocating funds on a competitive basis defined by the criterion of how the proposed project or intervention supports and implements the objectives of the strategy.

So it is wrong, as I see it, if indeed there should be a chapter on employment in the Treaty, that - as Mr Lage writes in his report - the Treaty should make it obligatory to coordinate Community policy for the creation of jobs; but if there is a chapter on employment in the Treaty, then at the most it should create an obligation to coordinate the national employment policies.
On behalf of my Group, I would also like to express our solidarity with Mr Lagendijk: we reject all the unfair attacks against him.
We need a fairer CAP with a large enough budget for what is asked of it.
My other point is connected with the northern dimension.
For women who want to or have to reconcile working life and motherhood, anything else would mean penalising or unjustifiably discriminating against them in their occupational and private life.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Convention has presented its responses to the questions posed at Laeken in the form of a draft Constitution.

That coup d’état did not just lead to a long and cruel civil war in Spain, therefore, but it also put an end to that hope for Europe that André Malraux had spoken of.
The current precariousness of employment - as is stated in one of the amendments - and public spending cuts do nothing to help the situation.
As a result of excellent work within the Commission and the working party, the practical solutions included in the proposed revised agreement bring major improvements in legislative procedure and planning, parliamentary scrutiny, obligations to provide information, and the Commission's presence in Parliament.
That is indecent and it is also an obstacle to all other development.
So I am optimistic, especially following our debate, that the leaders of the European Union, the European Council, will indeed send out a message of unity, cooperation and determination to deal efficiently with the problems ahead, and I envisage a decisive role for the European Parliament in paving the way forward.
How can we ensure that multinational crews, comprising Philippinos and Malaysians, for example, respect social standards? How can we ensure fair competition with the port's dock workers?
This Directive is based on a balance between two articles: article 3 which reflects mutual trust between States: if someone has decided to exercise a profession in a Member State, the mutual trust between the States, a principle of the Treaties, must enable him to continue his profession in another Member State; and article 4 which must be interpreted as a restrictive clause laying down compensatory measures in those cases where there is no equivalence.
(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to be here at Parliament's debate on the 2007 budget.
He did not say a word about the Europe of people.

I fear that wine ought to be made from grapes!
Indeed, in the procedural framework for decision-taking in the new CFSP, as I envisage it, the Commission's position will be that all cases relating to human rights will always be decided on the basis of qualified majority.

From the Union' s point of view, we are talking about a project costing billions of euros.
Women therefore already have to deal with more uncertainty, poor accrual of pensions and inadequate medical expenses.
A major fear is that NEPAD will eventually lead to the enrichment of those who are already rich and the challenge is to see the NEPAD story not as contravening the millennium objectives, such as halving the number of poor who have to survive on less than 1 dollar.
Some countries have not yet reached that position.
I remember announcements, official pronouncements, so to speak, describing the St Gotthard tunnel as the most important tunnel certainly in Europe if not in the world.

Hence we need creative ideas and solutions from the Commission, not just a list of the problems.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we have heard from both Mr Juncker and Mr Santer that in the last few years a great many resolutions and reports have been drawn up, a lot of words have been spoken, but unfortunately very little has been decided and the great plans have really not done anything to alter the facts, in particular that unemployment in the Union, at 18 million, is still unacceptably high.

We are also concerned about democratisation and securing peace and political stability in this region.
Nevertheless, the President’s view is that common sense should dictate that the floor should only be given on the subject being debated and not any other issue.
It is worth noting that, within the framework of the review, four years after the regulation entered into force, provision is made for examining possible additional bans.
What could we most usefully do to help that country?
Or is the suggestion to include only the agricultural use of biocides?
The EU's commitment to effective multilateralism is the guiding principle of European external action.
We must learn lessons from such an event.
I deplore it, but it is a fact.
Here, too, the Commission and the Council could, and should, do more.

Much as all of us long to see a democratic regime in Iraq, delaying the consolidation of Kurdish autonomy until then leaves a vacuum in which the murderous intrigue of recent years can continue.

This is one aspect of the aid policy for which the Member States are chiefly responsible.
As you know, for the structural funds the amount which might be at risk is the amount allocated in 2003 because now the N+2 comes automatically at the end of this year, and within the 2003 allocation we have not only ERDF, but also Social Fund and EAGGF funding.
The MAGP III programme failed to reach the objectives set because the compromise that was reached limited its scope from the outset and because various Member States failed to comply with their commitments.

Sadly, such a sentiment does not resonate in the People's Republic of China, whose Communist rulers are obsessed with unity, but not much thought is given to celebrating diversity.
Amendment No 22, which is put in more precise terms, is an example, stating that committee procedures only come into play when the scope of this regulation is to be extended to new products, and under no circumstances to the contrary.

If you heed this call, Commissioner, not only over and above the global strategy that you wish to create, but also in terms of the practical response of the governments and the Commission, then, within the framework of the current recovery plans, there will be provisions that deliver solutions to our fellow citizens straight away.
However, in view of the events of 11 September, we also need increased vigilance when it comes to the hospitality, aid and freedoms offered by the Union, to make sure that these are not abused by individual elements to breach the security of Europe's citizens or of the world as a whole.
We need to set an example and show our confidence in the leaders and people of Iran, the charming, dignified, talented people of Iran looking forward to democracy and reform, witness the hope they still place in President Hatami, who really is fighting to bring about changes in their theocratic regime.
By separating intellectual services from executive services we will be according the professions and the products of the mind their due value.
The way towards the creation of European political parties must remain open.

They have to do with the leasing of two buildings in Strasbourg.
It seems to me that there is a total lack of interest on the part of the Commission and the Council in the issue that we have raised.
In the interests of enhancing the transparency and clarity of the Strategy, I support the process of improving the drafting of consumer protection laws.
Complex problems such as the trend towards suburbanisation, the concentration of deprivation and unemployment in urban neighbourhoods, and increasing congestion, require integrated answers in transport, housing, training and employment schemes, which must be tailored to local needs.

(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Madam President, with regard to Amendment No 12, I wish to point out that after the vote on the amendment the committee experienced a certain amount of confusion, so the Council drew up a wording that seems more correct to me.
The debate is closed.
We are working on it.
The protection of women from domestic violence is not regulated by efficient instruments in the Latvian Republic.
The next item is the joint debate on:
We in the UPE Group are in favour of the deferred censure, partly because of practical considerations.
Looked at in a matter-of-fact way, that is also what our many common interests require.
After Maastricht and Amsterdam, the call for a European constitution will be much louder than before.
However, this also shows that the European Union is often pushed on foreign policy issues so that we are played off against the Americans and Russians.
But then, on the matter of substance, Mr Bourlanges is also wrong because it is in the recollection of everybody who followed it that Mrs Theato withdrew the corrigendum.
These concerns have been around for a long time and it is appropriate that we should take the decisions here and now.
Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration?
We are dealing with an ever more hard-line dictatorship in Serbia.
- (DE) I have just voted against the composition of this Commission and abstained from voting for Romano Prodi.
I do not wish to return to this topic, but I would like, however, to express a certain amount of satisfaction, despite the change to the legal basis, that the Commission and the Council have in any case adopted some elements which are extremely important to us.
Not only do the fifteen not seem to have taken into consideration the projections made yesterday by Agence Europe, according to which in a few years' time Turkey will have a larger population than any of the fifteen countries, which, according to the new method of calculation envisaged for the distribution of votes in the council, would make it the country with the most weight in the Council.
I should like to congratulate Mr Bowis on his report, which contains many good things: an admittance that pharmaceuticals can cause more mental illness than they cure; a recognition of the importance of childhood for mental health with a call for support for families; a recognition that employment can affect mental health for better and for worse; and the need to consult those who have recovered from mental illness to learn how recovery happened.
These include establishing a single asylum application procedure and single standards for qualification as a refugee, introducing a legal and effective mechanism for solidarity between the Member States - some countries are flooded with applications, while others escape more lightly - improving reception conditions for applicants, particularly for minors, and reducing the use of detention, and creating a European Asylum Support Office.
Mr Farage, are you willing to apply Article 9 of the treaty to ask to simply leave Europe?
Will the Commission do it?
The conclusions and guiding principles adopted by the Council on 30 September provide guidance on the ways to ensure that such responses preserve the integrity of the International Criminal Court, which is absolutely fundamental and vital.
We must really limit exceptions to structurally weak regions and define them for very tightly limited production quantities.
The Ecofin Council is in danger of not adopting its recommendation until the beginning of December, leaving Parliament with only ten days or so in which to deliver its opinion before the Dublin summit.

Therefore, I hope that in future the Commission and my colleagues in this House will ensure that agencies dealing with issues such as food safety, medicines control and evaluation and disease control and prevention are properly dealt with.
(DE) Thank you for your statements, Mr López Garrido.
I would also like to censure the recent statements by Mr Frattini, who in interviews referred to earlier confused his role as representative of the Commission with that of a member of the opposition, denying Mr Tajani this pleasure, when he would have been better to use his prestigious role to brighten the national political climate.
In a few months' time, Romanians and Bulgarians will go to the polls to elect their European representatives.

The Presidency believes that the interests of Europe and the European citizens must prevail over any defence of particular interests which could lead to substantial amendments of any kind to the Treaty.
If it is retained, I think it will be very difficult for us to vote in favour of the report, which would be unfortunate since the report has some very positive aspects for women and is greatly needed given the situation in which the majority of these women find themselves.
We are not in competition.
Before the vote on Amendment No 24:
It may help them in their everyday lives.
Mr President, as agreed with the coordinator of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, its chairman and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs, the text of the oral amendment is the following:

The great argument is that we must look after jobs and so on.
Mr President, unfavourable weather conditions can certainly explain the poor harvest in Bulgaria.
The Commission can only approve amendments which respect these principles.
But I am most pleased that numerous contributions to the debate have stated that we need to make a distinction between financial irregularity and fraud.
In this instance, the rapporteur, Mr Corbett, has been very open and transparent about what he seeks to achieve: he wants to make it harder for small groups to form and function; he wants to deny them the resources and privileges they are currently entitled to, which enables them to represent the will of those who elected them.
We do agree in principle that we must continue to reduce emissions and improve air quality.
Mr President, I think those of you who know me in this House, will know that I am not one to make a fuss.
As far as Greece is concerned, the new government is making an effort to find a solution which will put an end to the dispute.
In view of the time required to guarantee the quality of the checks and the consultations that the procedures require, ladies and gentlemen, despite the best efforts of my services and those of the Commission we shall be unable to pay all the appropriations earmarked for 1994-1999 in 2003.
Otherwise, how can we say afterwards, to the families and descendants of those who have died in this region, 'We did not know, we could not do anything'?

We are therefore, of course, less than satisfied, particularly in the areas of competition policy or fiscal policy, which are of immediate relevance to the internal market.
The children concerned will suffer for the rest of their lives as a result of the harm inflicted on them by adults.
Furthermore, in my view it also means that in future we should concentrate on fewer but more effective programmes and press ahead with them.
There is also a practical consequence, which arises from the old saying that he who can do the greater can certainly do the lesser, and it concerns the following: what sense is there for a body that has competence in criminal matters and in preventing and combating terrorist attacks, through being involved in a codecision process, to be subsequently excluded a priori when other measures are at stake which, by affecting citizens' rights, may even also be important in this context?
Is the Commission really willing to carry out such an overhaul?
It could be that a referendum will be lost somewhere in Europe.
– Mrs Muscardini and Mr Queiró, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the situation in Venezuela (B5-0147/2004).
Hence, for this service to function properly and achieve the objectives for which it was created, it must be given a budget that is sufficient to provide the human and material resources necessary for it to perform its activities well.
This must result in sustainable and more efficient management of marine resources.
We have thereby taken on board the comments made by the Foundation for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.
And a similar message was also communicated at the foreign ministers' informal meeting in Slovenia at the end of March.
People in Europe will surely not be the only ones footing the bill and experiencing the disadvantages without gaining any benefits.
The proposal falls in line with an approach similar to that adopted in the measures that have been implemented to date; measures that have proven to be inadequate and which, given the failure of this management policy, have highlighted the need for a change of direction, as stated in the Green Paper on the CFP.
It was reported recently in the 'Financial Times' that one militant Islamic organization was announcing a cease-fire after five years.

The Commission cannot, however, see how the measures planned would increase security in Hebron; if anything, these measures will serve to exacerbate the situation, which is already extremely tense.
Just read the reports by Amnesty International, or the report by our committee, of which I too was a member and to which Mr Paasilinna referred, or just look at what is happening in Chechnya.
We can, and should, undertake many things together.
There is thus no opportunity to return to the absolute calm required to get the process up and running.
I have received representations from constituents, so I welcome action on this matter.
I should like to ask the Commissioner how this multi-stakeholder forum is to be organised.
We therefore reject the proposal concerning increased powers of codecision for Parliament.
We could have this in conjunction with a general review of the transparency regulations. In this way, we will hopefully come to realise that transparency as a principle is not dangerous.
People who work on this type of registration are generally Congolese citizens who have been trained by the company that has provided the kits and, when millions of people are being registered, we must of course expect a percentage of purely technical errors and handling errors.
We are thus opposed to the European Parliament shaping opinion with a view to influencing the Member States to take a particular line on this important issue.
This is the objective behind setting up the COPE Fund, an objective which has my unbridled approval, all the more so because I am an MEP for the Loire Atlantique region, the département in France which has been affected the most by the Erika disaster and where tourism plays an important part.
What is our intention through these proposals?
It is fitting that, in a report on citizenship, the citizen's voice, via the NGOs, was heeded in drawing up the final report.
The food profiles are back and will hopefully at any rate prevent the most scandalous health claims.
In the case of Georgia, the proposed macro-financial assistance of EUR 46 million in the form of grant instalments is aimed at supporting Georgia's recovery after that country experienced a severe economic downturn following the eruption of the military conflict with Russia and the global financial crisis.
Mr President, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work on a subject which he has presented so clearly.
There has been mention of the need to globally achieve low-carbon development - I agree with that.
Today, I deliver that honour and that task back into your hands.
In my view - and you should read the conclusions of the Essen Summit in this respect -, the White Paper by Delors was too easily dismissed at Essen and I think that it is time to look at it once again.
What is going on in Poland is a departure from the observance of the Copenhagen criteria and from the core principles of this European Union, and so we have to make it clear at European level that this is unacceptable and that changes must be made without delay.
Finally, we can accept Amendments Nos 19 and 20, which relate to Article 8 on the implementation date - that is the 1.1.2000 instead of 1.1.2001, and insert a new provision calling for a report on the application of the Directive.
Thirdly, I would like to remind you that the Scientific Steering Committee has appointed a multi-disciplinary working group which is to deliver scientific results by the end of this year.
So among those matters that call for greater commitment I would mention, specifically, rethinking the concept of Europe to strengthen - and certainly renew - its social model, its elements of social cohesion, protection and development of individuals and of human resources, which will be able to set their mark on a new, positive European identity.
That is what happens when small airlines fly without checks being carried out.
Once all the states formed from the disintegration of the Yugoslav Federation have been admitted to the European Union, this will also close the final wounds of a violent past, which is still an issue for the entire European community.
The accessibility of transport to persons with reduced mobility is a really important issue for the European Union at present.
When we talk about accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, we are talking about work which has been going on for 10 years now and about many fears concerning, inter alia, competition between the Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.
They have demonstrated once again the diversity of opinion and breadth of different ideas in Europe; how difficult and yet how necessary it is to look for some sort of common denominator and common voice.
We monitor banking supervision, but this is not one of the tasks of the Central Bank.
Overall, then, the Commission can only express its agreement.
As the merchant bank that is financing the speculators, it has to be well informed!
We therefore abstained from voting on Amendment 38.
Bearing in mind that this critical state of affairs is a one-off occurrence which we could not have forecast 2 or 3 years ago, may we expect a new intervention by the Commission in this particular situation, in addition to what you have told us?
We must reach agreement here, in all the European Union' s ports, from Marseilles, through to Rotterdam, to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships drop anchor.
That is the minimum requirement.
This does not mean that the Commission should not examine these allegations closely.
Whilst the conference in Montreal was a minor success, it was not enough – not by a long shot in my view.
Thirdly, there is transparency.
I would call on the Commission finally to do something about these lists after three years of promises, for we want a parliamentary democracy and not a democracy of experts.
In my view, we are also seeing what is now patently unlawful conduct not only in the large-scale but also in small-scale fisheries.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with these guidelines for the 2010 budget, Parliament in plenary will be not only determining the guidelines for budgetary policy but also, in the absence of a motion for a resolution of the political groups on the subject, reacting to the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy.
In particular, this is true of all the research into transmutation. The latter is one of the most promising options for the future.
Mr President, very briefly, of course.
Although there are many here who wish to forget that, the French and Dutch voted ‘no’ in their referendums.
Calling for a small increase or a freeze is derisory - that is why I voted against a freeze - when what is really needed is a sharp cut in the budget to give the taxpayer a break.
Once again, we are being forced to agree to providing Community funding, as Mr Marinho said, in order to be able to have a say as well.
Although the situation has changed immeasurably since the attacks on the USA, we have done a great deal without demanding a dramatic increase in expenditure.
I have been in contact for the last two years with all the ministers in all the Member States.
We are dealing with an ideal that we would all love to see: a shorter working week, more money, less taxation, more leisure time.
Unfortunately, parents are not mentioned anywhere in the draft resolution.
Liberal Democrats and Reformers believe that governments should first, as the admirable Mr Colom i Naval has suggested, take a long, hard look at what they have asked the European Union to do, and then give the institutions the resources they need to do the job.
Mr President, I think that, in his excellent report, the rapporteur has put his finger on the crux of the matter regarding the implementation and the effectiveness of the Union's political, economic and social cohesion.
We are also agreed that monetary policy should be designed and implemented by a European Central Bank which is independent.
In this respect the institutional framework resulting from the Treaty of Amsterdam delivers us a Europe with a paralyzed decision-making capacity, increasingly resembling a huge market and less and less like the Europe our fathers wanted and this Parliament hoped for.
As Mr Trakatellis said, that is extremely important.
That is why I have to say that - as has already been demonstrated - the solution was not to enlarge NATO eastwards, but rather to enlarge the EU and adopt a policy of association and economic support which would promote economic and political integration and combat irredentist nationalism.
- Before the vote on Amendment 46
The problem is particularly significant in relation to the ageing of the population of Europe.
. (NL) Nuclear energy is a very controversial issue, but following years of inactivity in the wake of the Harrisburg and Chernobyl disasters, attempts are once again being made to build new nuclear plants.
Mr President, the debate on GMOs has often generated more confusion than clarity.
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution expressing the solidarity of members of the European Parliament with the Japanese people and their government after the striking events of recent days.
We believe that there are basically three prerequisites for implementing the strategy effectively: a list of priorities and common projects, coordination at Commission level and appropriate funding so that we can achieve the goal we all want.
This means that our foremost task should be to get small and medium-sized enterprises, as the powerhouse behind our job creation, back on their feet again.
But the reference is to legally recognised organisations, NGOs, with which all of us are familiar.
Otherwise, our 2005 budget already belongs to the cosy little world of a Europe with worldwide ambitions and a provincial budget.
Problems do not arise. There is already a duty of confidentiality, and I should like to urge you to adopt the amendment which we tabled in this connection.
Who can believe that peace for the Israelis and Palestinians will be built through a policy that in fact leads to the radicalisation of the people of Israel and of Palestine?
The choice is ours, and let there be no doubt that we will be called to account for the consequences of our decisions.
Everything was ratified at the Laeken Summit on 14 December 2001.
We will send someone to Colombia to see what we can do as a European Group and we hope, within a few weeks, to have a different option than simply to deplore that our candidate has been kidnapped.
Whenever we were sitting at night, it was always my ambition to finish at 12 midnight precisely.
The fleet in my country regulates capacity by reducing activity (the "days at sea restrictions" ).
The budget negotiations have been really complicated.
With the death penalty, that opportunity is irretrievably lost - quite apart from the fact that the death penalty is flagrantly abused in some cases.
All of this clearly shows that the 2006 agreement on the ENPI regulation gave us a tool which allows us to deliver and produce tangible results.
If, in the end, we can assume - as some surely will - that this proposal is inevitable, please at least give a bit of forethought to some things that are not yet under consideration.
Such activities help to reduce economic differences and are a catalyst in the activities of various associations, and they therefore create social capital.
We are of course entering a grey area here, and you may say, Mr Marset Campos, that these are civilian targets, such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure, whilst others will tell me that they are military targets, because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by Mr Milosevic' s forces in Kosovo.
Madam President, Mrs Dati, thank you for having urged on this European Council which was able to reach a consensus in this area and arrive at these political agreements.
Europe has thus missed an opportunity to extend its rules worldwide and to achieve uniform regulation.
Because appearances conceal certain ambiguities which could bring back in through the window what has gone out through the door, because many measures are still not being applied, many measures are inadequate, and because there is a need to point up the numerous contradictions pervading the whole issue of female employment and unemployment.
In many places it is now teachers who have the most difficulty in adapting to this type of information while young people view it more naturally.
We all want OLAF to be able to commence its work properly as soon as possible and work effectively for the benefit of the European Union.
Like the other advocates of this initiative, the Commission will always be available to facilitate this process by any means possible.
Other areas of concern contained in the report include the history of Europe, distance learning and mobility for researchers. I regret that digital cinema, the cinema of tomorrow, has disappeared from this list.
We need the information it provides, but we regret that many areas of activity have seen no improvement for years, because these findings bring the European Union into disrepute.
The work must continue and my report acknowledges the fact that there is more still to be done.
We have succeeded in doing this.
Women continue to carry most of the responsibility for the care of children.
Finally, point six: promotion is indeed an important aspect.
The debate is scheduled for 5.30 p.m.
I therefore think that it is important to deal with the weaknesses in the financial system at global level and learn all the lessons from the crisis by improving the quality of risk management and the transparency of the financial markets.
I should have talked at more length about the European energy policy.
I also agree with the pragmatic and rational approach to immigration policy.
. That is a very good point.
During these negotiations, the European Union must show what it is doing to ensure that trade rules will help improve this situation in the future.
Parliament really must vote in favour of Mrs Cerdeira's report tomorrow and in so doing clearly express its rejection of a fortress Europe, of the kind that is in the process of being created, and it must also clearly declare its support for the right to live in a family, which is an absolutely essential right in all of our democracies.
I believe that considerable efforts have been made, both by the Council and by this Parliament, to reach to a compromise agreement, with compromise measures which ended in 2006.
In addition, the actions of the Burmese military regime and the acts of violence against the Rohingya minority should be strongly condemned, and calls should be made for them to have full citizens' rights restored.
I am aware of all the efforts that have been made throughout the period of negotiations.
One should remember last July's banking stress tests, when the Commission effectively signed off on the future of the very banks in Ireland that are at the heart of the crisis.
I hope that this SAVE II programme will be adopted but there is much that could be done to improve it.
Apart from the fact that working hours reductions can help to create more jobs, they can of course also improve the quality of life for the individual - for the unemployed person who can get a job, but also for one who already has a job but gains more time for the family and for leisure activities, voluntary service and political work.
Data protection therefore needs to be thought of differently, encapsulating data together so it cannot be amalgamated in an unauthorised way.
The off the Flemish coast was a chilling example of this.
Secondly, the format of the decision is totally unreasonable, i.e. that we have a technical committee which is, in practice, creating legislation.
The Council is, of course, willing to examine any new text submitted by Mr Harbinson or anybody else.
The Commission is strongly committed to the fight against terrorism and intends to continue working for the prevention of terrorism and the protection of our citizens and infrastructures by bringing terrorists to justice and by responding adequately to terrorist attacks in order to save as many innocent lives as possible.
I have nothing further to say.
It is therefore important to maintain the date of 2012 for the changeover from analogue to digital, so that Europe is not left behind, because our competitors have set much earlier dates: the United States, 2009, South Korea, 2010, and Japan, 2011.
Mr President, everyone is aware that the Phare programme is the principal instrument of financial support for the pre-accession strategy.
People have started to rebuild in the affected areas.
I cannot share that opinion, because if there is a bloc, organisation or entity that has shown practical signs of having ambitious targets, of seeking to go further and of showing a real concern for a problem that affects our citizens, then that entity is the European Union.
It has likewise been pointed out that Kosovo is a sui generis case, and so independence poses no threat to the international principles of law for resolving conflict.
It would be wrong to claim that a Community policy, with actions and resources, would not increase the overall competitiveness of European tourism compared with others, given the effects of tourism on employment, cohesion, the environment, the generation of resources, etc.
This is where the European players can, and indeed must, play a mediating role, and I welcome the comment Mr Gloser made in this connection.
These countries have the right to choose the rate at which their borders are opened up and their economies liberalised.
Although I too believe that going back to the railway policies of the past is no longer an option, as a politician and trade unionist the various strategies for moving towards greater liberalisation fill me with fear for the future.
Not surprisingly, countries with extensive sea or land borders close to countries of origin will be the major points of entry and are thus expected to bear the major responsibility for asylum seekers, bailed out presumably by the refugee fund.
If we look at what really happens, however, it is often not about a child who goes to school or food which is grown locally in a more productive way. Very often, economic interests of the various Member States in Europe take priority over poverty issues in the relevant countries.
I am able to say today that, despite all the differences of political opinion in the committee, our real and overriding concern was to bring the facts to light and, above all, to come to the conclusions that are needed if we are to avoid such a disaster repeating itself.
We have a problem with Amendment No 6 because, according to our interpretation, it goes against the Treaty because the Treaty provides that these kinds of proposals must be submitted to the Council.
Anybody who has had the thrill of being in a real tropical forest will never forget the experience and we should certainly not deny our children that.
Amending the Financial Regulation is a small but significant step on the way to the third stage of monetary union.
Whites are being systematically intimidated and driven from their land through violent means to punish them for their support for the opposition and to buy the votes of the landless farmers.
Highly indebted countries have debt-servicing obligations that can siphon off as much as a quarter of the value of their exports.
Needless to say, this is a more effective monitoring method than the random measurement method used twice a year.
There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Hence our vote against.
The countries with the lowest incomes are right to stage a protest against this.
Really, how do we get the money that we promised for adaptation and forest protection?
With so much oil in the back garden, the production of long-range rockets, the export of terrorism, and religious terrorism, well, Mr President, this true face of Iran, I feel very uneasy about this.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am happy to be here for the debate on Mr Bono's report and I should like to thank him for his contribution and the committee for its work.
This binding information procedure gives some sort of customs validity to the products for three years.
This has proved damaging in the Eurostat case.
We must ensure that it is not only in early detection that breakthroughs are widely promoted throughout the EU.
This is a task which all MEPs, the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature: the creation, as has been said already, of an area of freedom, security and justice.
The fear of a new war is now real and the devastating hostilities of the recent past may once again become a nightmare reality of the present.
(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure.)
Perhaps political emotions impair the ability to rationally assess the new Polish Government.
Job creation goes hand-in-hand with the development of infrastructures and services which make it possible to combine work with domestic responsibilities, in order to make women less socially isolated and to seek new alternatives to traditional working structures.
This directive will almost certainly cost tens of thousands of jobs in the Netherlands and in Germany and, in time, will undermine the present social system.
Equally, we need to encourage the use of vine-based products to enrich wines, for example using grape must instead of sugar.
As a result, it is the people of Chad who are suffering, and we must urge everyone - internationally, nationally and locally - to work together to bring this crisis to an end, and then build for the future again.
It also claims that NATO and the European Union are complementary, ignoring the subordinate role of the European Union within NATO and the need to promote an independent and non-aggressive European foreign policy.
We can endorse all his conclusions.
For Amendment 589, budget line B5-3111, the correct amount is EUR 300 000.
This can be achieved through effective cooperation between bodies at national, regional and local levels.
Separatist forces must be firmly resisted.
I would like to thank the Danish Presidency for its active contribution.
We have made maternity leave longer and better paid, and we have, for the first time in European history, introduced paternity leave.
On the one hand they introduce a concept which is legally very dubious, i.e. the probable causal relationship concept which could be a source of many disputes, and, on the other hand, they significantly increase the charges on enterprises by doubling the duration of the period of limitation and the amount of the liability threshold.
The aim is to make the process of adding new fibres to the harmonised list of textile fibre names more transparent, and to adapt the legislation to technological developments in the textile industry.
In September 2009, I asked Commissioner Andor what specific measures he would introduce to assist SMEs, following my similar request of him when he spoke to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on taking up the portfolio.
Like my colleague, I, too, would be concerned about rural development policy - albeit not as part of the cohesion policy, more in line with the CAP - but, at the same time, it is absolutely vital that it is not squeezed in any future proposals because rural development, and particularly the family farm, is vital for the social infrastructure of society.
Thirdly, the governments of the States must commit themselves to carrying out a thorough study of the degree of compliance and, above all, of non-compliance with the current rules, international embargos and, in the case of Europe, strict application of the Code of Conduct on arms exports.
In most Member States, the laws prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages to young people are adequate; the problem is the low level of compliance.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I reiterate the thanks to Mrs Sudre for her work on this report and for achieving a majority consensus in the Committee on Regional Development on the policy for the outermost regions.
The governments are transferring new competences to Europe without transferring resources, thus cutting the links, and yet they are able to propose increases which can only be explained by their being in the pocket of lobbies.
That is what has happened in this case, and I think it is important that the European Parliament remains consistent and makes itself heard on human rights issues, even if this is unpleasant for my own country.
The same thing could also be said about the idea of a simple rotation principle and about how this would work, which we believe should be properly spelt out if the scenario of a Commission consisting of only 20 members is adopted.
It is also worth remembering that Mercosur countries have benefited, as my honourable friend the President-in-Office pointed out, from the EU GSP mechanism for quite a long time.
This is a key factor for the support of the peoples of Europe and it is also, quite simply, an essential condition for the success of the Lisbon Strategy and for strengthening the competitiveness and economic efficiency of the European Union.
