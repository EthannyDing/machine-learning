I myself have been able to learn a great deal and therefore hope that the chamber will support this proposal in full.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, time and again this Parliament has had to struggle with a very lax attitude to democracy on the part of the European Council.
I am in favour of this resolution because its main aim is to ensure the highest level of security for populations following disasters like the one that happened recently in Japan.
All the more, it is unacceptable to leave the process in the hands of multinationals, because the interests they represent are not the best guarantee of respect for the integrity of human life.
Mr President, I would also like to pass on my best regards to Mr Karlsson, thank him for his presentation and all the work he has done over the past few years.
This is unfortunate, and I will obviously be asking for a reason in certain cases: in the specific case of Italy, for example, it has requested more time to respond.

Debate in Poland is dominated by squabbles between two parties.
Pakistan has been at the forefront of this battle, sometimes carrying a very heavy burden on behalf of the international community, a heavy burden sometimes carried on weak shoulders, a burden the people of Pakistan have carried, absorbing so much violence and carnage which would otherwise have made its way into other parts of the world.
It stimulated a debate, and society itself took charge of it.

This proposal thus gives added impetus to the stabilisation and association process.
   Certain vulnerable parts of the world attract more attention from the international community than others.
These jobs often lack correct contracts and social benefits.
I see no reason why this preamble should not be removed from the Border Treaty as the Tartu Peace Treaty is still a valid international treaty and the new Border Treaty only acknowledges the control line between Estonia and Russia, their border, and the external border of the European Union.
I would like to hear from the Commission that it will intervene not merely by recommending better labelling and better testing - though, of course, we need that - but by taking action to outlaw these activities, which are a total fraud on the public and are likely in one respect to cause serious concern, because the injection of beef protein - which the perpetrators admit has come from countries where there is BSE, and they have not tested the products for that - may cause serious public concern as well.
The pathological hunt to locate the contamination site led to premature accusations of guilt all round, and these arguments led to days of negative headlines and total uncertainty on the part of consumers.
The first aspect concerns competition.
   . – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue we are discussing today is one of the most important – I believe most important – pre-legislative proposals on the EU agenda for this parliamentary term.

Demographic changes present not only serious challenges but also new opportunities.
Our calls have fallen upon deaf ears.
With regard to the translation problem, what Mrs Schleicher is referring to is a very important factor as the terminology is indeed highly technical in this field and a suitable translation is essential.

Mr Johannes Swoboda agreed with me.
Anything else would have infringed the subsidiarity principle.
I must also stress that these local labour markets are incredibly important for quality of life and social welfare in various ways.
One more question for Mrs Fischer Boel: what is your view of such a certification system?
In 1997, the Commission will set in motion farreaching reforms designed to modernize the way it is run and to improve its performance.
Reduction in working hours (continuation)
Perhaps the biggest problem here is transport safety, which involves securing the social conditions of employees, including cases where aircraft are hired out together with crews, as well as the safety of passengers, who are traditionally the priority.
Although EU agricultural policy aims to provide safe, high-quality food products and contributes to the protection of the environment and to renewable energies, it must be adequately financed so as to encourage farmers to use modern, environmentally sound techniques.

On the title, Amendment No 1, it is the Commission's view that it is better that we stick to the more general terms of the original proposal.
We would therefore argue that, in those quite specific cases, in other words not as a general rule but in those specific cases, a description of the CVs and experience of the staff should suffice.
We, the radicals, have introduced a little amendment so that, unless the situation in that country changes drastically, if no privatization or political reform is carried out there, it will be put under international supervision in six months, because it not only does not guarantee liberty, it does not even guarantee bread for its inhabitants.
I should also like to compliment Mr Mulder on his work.
Let us go the right way.

I note that, on certain points, it has been said that action must be taken on the UK’s rebate.
Otherwise, we could soon be voted down in this House.
The use of the heavy metals mercury, cadmium and lead in batteries must be limited as far as possible. Parliament must therefore tighten up the Council proposal now before us.

As to Mrs Müller's request, once the legislation is adopted my services will organise a hearing with a view to adequately implement Article 2(2), where all stakeholders will be given the possibility to have input.

That is why we have the intention - and this will be important for Parliament - to submit a mid-term review of the implementation of the Stockholm Programme in 2012, in order to ensure that the programme remains in line with European and global developments.
On the other hand, I have my reservations on how much we should go on discussing the extension of competences, even regarding decisions taken through codecision in the field of legal immigration when there is still so much to do in the field of illegal immigration, especially in countries directly facing the problems and burdens of illegal immigration.
Therefore, I was disappointed that what is otherwise a good and important report calls into question what is for me a fundamental principle of something being done in return in terms of free and human rights, and the opportunity for peacekeeping operations within the European Investment Fund.

Moreover, Afghanistan is not the only country where the rights of women are violated on a massive scale.
Madam President, I am sure that nobody here is suffering an attack of Alzheimer' s, but that some people are surely seeking to manipulate this Parliament for reasons of party politics in their own countries, which I believe we should all oppose, Madam President.

Mr President, thank you for your sincere words concerning Mrs Anna Lindh.

Parliament will be able to reach a far more balanced verdict on it in the next one.
It is inadmissible that those who shoot civilian demonstrators be called heroes of the nation and promised an amnesty.
The flooding caused severe damage to the agricultural sector, residential properties and businesses, to the road network and to other infrastructure.
As stressed in the resolution, it will have to start by satisfying certain basic needs of the people, such as running water, housing and medical care, otherwise it will clearly be unable to push ahead with other reforms because it will not have the consent of the people.
Here too there has been enough talking: it is high time for action!
I would like to ask the Commissioner to continue with her annual reports but to come to us on a regular basis so that we can help her improve utilization by putting pressure on the Member States, so that we can take swift action when bottlenecks and obstacles occur.
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes
In my report on EU-India Trade and Economic Relations, I called on 'both India and Pakistan to further reduce administrative impediments to implementing trade-related confidence-building measures and for the EU to offer technical assistance, if required, in this regard'.
Clearly there is a lot that can be done in Europe.
Member States must be able to maintain their right to take decisions on energy and exploit their own energy sources, but at the same time we need cooperation, an exchange of best experience and also common rules and regulations to promote the establishment of a common energy policy.
In areas with lower yields, in addition to agricultural activity, the economic activities linked to it would also disappear, and this would create unprecedented problems in economic, social, environmental and land planning terms.
In your task force report, you indicated your support and that of the Commission for the local devolved administration and the work that it is doing in securing a peaceful and prosperous future for the people of Northern Ireland.
I just want to know what the reason for this is.

   – Mr President, the aim of the resolution is to prepare the guidelines before the conference to revise the Treaty of Non-Proliferation.

I am grateful to Parliament for having understood this and for having supported us as it has done.

We talk about improving the quality of training in Parliament.
Import of poultry carcases (debate)
As regards Pakistan, which is the subject of the resolution we are now discussing, I want to say that the GUE/NGL Group supports the resolution in its entirety.
It is not possible for us to stand before our electorate with our heads held high and say that we have succeeded in regulating this netherworld effectively.
I will not go into them all.
Mr Alyssandrakis, I do not agree with you that Cyprus' accession, in the form currently proposed, will mean a de jure division of the island.
At the last meeting of the Governing Council at the beginning of June, which was devoted to our stance on monetary policy, this led us to the conclusion that the risks are there, the mitigating effects seem to be emerging, and we must wait and see how things develop.
We proposed that last Thursday.
If the Commission does nothing else after today's debate, I hope it will seek to establish a level playing field and seek to remove gross state aids such as those practised in Holland which I believe are grossly unfair.
All its other advantages - from transport to energy production - can only be secondary in the light of the importance of water as a strategic commodity.
10. Rear registration plate of two or three-wheel motor vehicles (vote)
Sixteen new priority projects have been added to what was until recently 14, in order to take account of the accession of the new EU Member States.
Madam President, in support of the urgent procedure, and to specifically respond to this point, I would like to repeat that this is not a case of Parliament giving its opinion on a list.
Concerning Mrs Oddy's proposal to consider the possibility of putting Mary Robinson in charge of a special mission aimed at promoting a rapprochement between the two sides and to put an end to the conflict which is raging in the country, I am completely open to this proposal.
The Commission will continue to take all necessary measures, firstly to help Turkey in its fight against torture and ill-treatment, and secondly in order to monitor current developments.
Can the Commission indicate to what extent this matter has been considered at EU level and, if so, how does the Commission consider this type of crime can be effectively dealt with?
For this reason we are particularly delighted that the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 8 April has taken into account the difficulties in applying this directive encountered by a large number of, mainly small, companies, and also by many economic sectors in the search for a compromise on limit values and on the implementation deadline for the requirements imposed by the new directive on companies.
I do not know why you denied me the opportunity to speak.
China should do the same in Tibet as Slovakia does for its Hungarian minority, with Hungarian minority children able to study in Hungarian from nursery school through to primary school and secondary school.
However, there are no actual examples and I wonder whether that is because, under examination, they would not stand up against the strained argument that is put forward - an argument against a non-member state, based on an old free trade agreement, designed primarily to deal with the trade in goods.
Mr President, a while ago, one Member quite rightly condemned cloning in this plenary and called for it to be universally rejected.
We need the 12-day rule for occasional cross-border coach services.
It is therefore the same thing, but our legal experts thought that it was better to word it in this way.
The Dayton Agreement must be implemented.
This conflict had been smouldering for years.
This is the case for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.
The notes fall within the competence of the European Central Bank, and Mr Trichet will say what he needs to say on behalf of the Bank.
Then there is the clean slate, a provision that ends the unfortunate practice of deducting advances from featured artists' royalties.
That will lead to not only more deaths on the road, but to health problems for the hauliers themselves.
I believe every effort should continue to be made, because any deferment, any delay, would have a serious negative impact on public opinion in the acceding state and only encourage those interests most opposed to reform.
I was told it was not a committee delegation in a letter from the chairman, Mrs D'Ancona, and I merely informed the government of the Member State that it was not a committee delegation.
The soldiers' bodies were identified through DNA a few weeks ago after they were killed 35 years ago and thrown down a well in the occupied northern part of the island.
Far from being the symbol of a new post-Soviet Europe, the euro is, on the contrary, the supreme symbol of a construction of Europe which was conceived during and out of the Cold War, and which has not been able to reconsider its foundations and objectives in the light of the new geopolitical situation.
For future growth, making a living must not equate to making a killing.
Waste on the green list is waste whose transfer is generally not considered to pose any risk to the environment.
I can tell the Council representative that while we welcome the adoption of a convention, Parliament will not support a system of options.
Now that we want sustainable development to be given a leading place in the new Treaty, there will be a legal base for the purpose of this report: research serving sustainability.
The inspectors' reports to the Security Council are conclusive in terms of the non-compliance with Resolution 1441.
If anybody has a point of order, they can put it.
On the other hand, there are other problems such as the definition of the concept of higher education and the balance between article 3 - recognition of diplomas per se - and article 4 which, in certain circumstances, enables the Member States to introduce additional requirements.
in writing. - (FR) The adoption of this decision is a decisive step towards reinforcement of the internal electronic communications market.
Consequently, few demands are made as regards the policy changes required.
I shall deal with only four of them.
For example, I believe that Europol is an important tool which, combined with an effective network of experts and a special unit whose members have had training on very specific issues, can be used to combat child pornography and prostitution.
He was a Vice-President and Director of US investment bank Goldman Sachs, where his responsibilities included Europe and contact with the national governments there.
The high-speed rail network between Munich and Verona is a case in point: the cost and the environmental impact of the Brenner tunnel are such that this project is not feasible, even according to the governments of the countries concerned, Germany, Austria and Italy.
Finally, I should like to point out that the global financial crisis is now one year old.
Given that the agreed text is acknowledged as better than the Council general approach, this does not make sense.
Is that not the method that promises success?
In particular I should like to thank Gerry Collins for his warm welcome.
The Bösch report, which follows on from the Special Report of the Court of Auditors on the running of the Commission's Unit for the Coordination of Fraud Prevention (UCLAF), presents overwhelming conclusions. During the 10 years this unit has existed, it has not managed to finalise its procedural rules, nor to obtain the independence and security in handling information that would be needed for effective financial control.
Our poor economic growth is largely home-made: 'made in Europe'.
If a declaration was made but not recorded in the Minutes, we shall look into the matter.
It is now customary, with each presidency, for the Defence Minister to attend a parliamentary sitting. This marks real progress.
We came to the conclusion that in 1996 5.4 % of the events on which payments were based were associated with serious errors, and we point out that the error rate in the field of structural assistance is above average, and in the field of agricultural policy it is below average.
I should like to point out as rapporteur that certain proposals of the Agriculture Committee ought to be re-examined to get things in proportion.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I share the assessment of the rapporteur, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, concerning the problems of dependence on imports and the growing dependence on imports of energy fuels and I have little disagreement with it - the report describes it very well.
The regulation also makes specific reference to the needs of indigenous and forest-dependent people and the need for gender considerations to be taken into account.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the total for Category 5, administrative expenditure, has been set at EUR 4.7 billion, with an increase of 4 % - or EUR 182 million - over 1998.
   . I certainly concur with the question the honourable Member has put to me in terms of the need to delineate between legislation where it is appropriate and, indeed, where there are areas where there are alternatives to regulation that should be considered.
Now those formulas must be applied.
This primarily involves health care, including clinical and preventive research and medical technologies.
Finally, it seems to me that perhaps the most important thing we have to do - which is a challenge ahead of us - is to influence and change public opinion on the need for conservation and efficiency.
The second point is that these reports refer to 1999.
A third issue in this context concerned the fact that we wanted to ensure that these nominal quantities would not be abolished automatically after a certain time, but that the European Commission would assess the consequences and the possibilities beforehand and would consider by means of an impact assessment whether this was appropriate, what consequences could arise as a result and how we might respond to any disruption of the market.
However, there does have to be responsibility on all Member States - those in the north and also those in the south - to properly implement EU law on the reception of migrants and on the processing of claims with financial and other help, and also on integration and the enforcement of labour laws.
Your report has been dealt with, Mr Pex, and I am not going to continue this discussion because it is not a matter for the House to decide on at the moment, since it is not on the agenda.
Directives need to be changed, but so do attitudes.
This report is a microcosm of Paolo Costa's work, because it is a report that clearly shows that the wisdom of Solomon, allied to the diplomatic skills of the United Nations, is often needed when dealing with such technical details like 'use it or lose it on the slot'.

There is nothing even-handed in equating, no matter how justified they are, the political demands of Gaza with the vicious and repeated terrorist attacks on Israel as epitomised by the attack on the school.
No doubt there are indeed problems involving human rights, interest rate policy and environmental standards, but they must not be solved through protectionism.
There is no respect for women's rights; for example, women are prevented from observing International Women's Day publicly.
A little more conservatism in the calculations would not have gone amiss.
We need be very wary of wealthy business interests controlling the flow of information and pushing a self serving market driven, anti-regulation, and, often, anti-Trade Union agenda.
Once again, I would like to congratulate all fellow Members who serve on the committee, and I would like Mr Harbour to accept these thanks and congratulations on their behalf.
Thank you, Mr President.
Although it is in a minority in numerical terms, the European Union nevertheless plays a leading role in the Council and has established itself as a major player.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, with this discussion the sport of figure skating comes to mind.
I have to put to you: do you have the courage to act on your convictions and on this Parliament's beliefs?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness.
Only lack of confidence can explain the fact that, despite high company profits, lower interest rates and reduced company taxes, investment has failed to materialize, especially in the private sector. And it is not encouraging that the rate of public investment has also fallen, from 3.5 % to less than 2.5 % of GDP.
From this point of view, this agreement between the European Union and Georgia is a very important one.
Things that are not understood will of course not make much sense.
In Mr Newman's report on the Ombudsman's annual report there are four main questions that I would like to comment on briefly.
Shall I ask the Commission if it is prepared to make its declaration?

The Commission can support this course of action, as it increases legal certainty and also improves environmental safeguards.
Mr President, the Amsterdam Treaty sets new standards for health policy in Europe.
The obligation to intervene, invented to support causes that were far less just, must be applied to the Middle East with determination and steadfastness.

The hinterland is rural, arable farmland and pasture, without many SMEs.
on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, as a standing rapporteur on relations with Russia, may I inform you that we have already launched a very thorough process in order to deal with all the serious matters which are important in our relations with Russia.
The rapporteur is right in calling for an effective system to control imported canned goods from third countries and the origin of products, a definite policy of quality which should be combined with an adequate promotional campaign.
If we want to prevent tragedies such as those at Dover from happening again, extending the Third Pillar should not be delayed any further, and we are hopeful after President Chirac' s address and Minister Queyranne' s speech.
You have stood by your word.
I should like to repeat here what I said at the Conference of Presidents on behalf of my group.
Mr Poettering himself said in a television interview that the presence in the Commission of Mrs Kroes, who has so many scandals behind her, would not be tolerated.

According to the Swedish government's interpretation of the decision taken at Cologne in 1999, a relevant UN Security Council resolution has to have been adopted.
I wonder what further urgent comments the European Parliament should now have to make on this.
Mr President, excuse my lateness. I see, however, that my name is not on the list of members present.
The outcome cannot be described as something that has produced a simplification of legislation in Europe, quite the opposite, it has all become more bureaucratic, more complicated, harder to understand and more inefficient, the opposite of ‘slim’, I would call the directive ‘thick’, to borrow the English word.
Secondly, a topic fundamental to Parliament as an institution. From the institutional point of view Mr Costa has managed to increase comitology in relation to methods of scanning and I believe that in future this too will put right a few misunderstandings which have arisen in the past, for example in relation to liquids; this is another area where I believe we must improve.
However, while the many advantages are both immediate and conspicuous, I welcome more than anything else the fact that the FTA has an effective bilateral safeguard mechanism - a safeguard that allows the EU to restore MFN duty rates, should it be that this particular FTA has led to or threatens to cause serious injury to EU domestic industry.
12. European Quality Assurance Reference Framework for Vocational Education and Training (
The Commissioner claims that, strictly speaking, it is possible, even under current procedures, for these businesses to claim damages.

Administrative exclusion and preferential treatment for individual groups is not a path towards social inclusion, but towards continued social exclusion.
As the rapporteur has clearly said, the two worlds are distinguished because of the poverty which exists in the developing world.
Why can the Council not take it up and approve it?
However, I should perhaps be more moderate in my views tonight.
I believe it is essential to extend this fund's scope for intervention to pollution caused by noxious and hazardous substances.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, many in this House will remember that at first reading, this was an extremely hot topic, and I think we are hearing only some of the differences between us.
Since you mention sport, I had a look at the French newspapers this morning, wondering what they would write today about Mr Sarkozy's visit to the European Parliament.
I have heard that it has become a little bit passé to speak of peace to generations in Europe who have never known war.
This federal assistance is supplanted by US state and local government support to Boeing in the form of tax breaks, favourable real estate and local infrastructure improvements intended to secure the company's presence and job base in selected US cities.
Indeed, that would be the result of the current proposal if it were not amended.
Imposing such a sunset clause is clearly not in line with the recent agreement on the revised comitology procedure.
There are alternatives and the only way we will achieve them is to impose a ban.
I believe that is a reasonable measure which the European Union can support, but which it must support jointly with others, in particular the United States and the Russian Federation.

From the time of the first reading of the reports in the European Parliament up to the Berlin European Council at the end of March, Parliament influenced and modified the results in the course of intensive discussions, and in intensive negotiations after Berlin.
In 2000 the target for the appointment of women to A1 was two appointments and the target for A2 was five appointments.
All I can do is mention the Swedish law prohibiting the purchase of sexual services and, of course, the Austrian legislation.
I would ask her - although she is no longer here - whether not labelling something that was 100% composed of GMOs would mean that we were being more politically honest with consumers.
The world needs to understand, for one thing, that peace does not come through immigration but through self-reliant development and, for another, that real proletarianisation sets in when people lose their cultural roots.
My second point is that this is probably a European record in terms of efficiency, because I do not know of a major legislative package which was introduced on Valentine's Day - 14 February - 2007 by the Commission and approved by Coreper on 13 February 2008 - one day under a year.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Can we try to find some way of conveying our views to the Russian Government and sorting out this question of freedom of the press and expression which bedevils relations between the Russian Federation and the European Union?
It will clearly not be easy to find a balanced and equitable solution in this very complex situation and, frankly, the Commission will need a fair amount of ingenuity and flexibility in order to lead this case to a solution acceptable for the Member States and the economic operators.

At European level, we have laid down minimum rules with which all Member States and all enterprises must comply in the event of large-scale job reductions or other measures potentially affecting workers.
This does not mean structures of aggression, but structures which actively build peace. Painfully, we failed to do this in advance of the Iraq war, but it has been the European Union's mission since our founding fathers started it up in 1952.
More than 20 directives have been adopted that follow this approach, a concrete example of which is the Machinery Directive.
The first is the issue of our own working methods.
I do not think so.
This might be supported by the addition of texts in an article of the proposal, but the reference in the explanatory memorandum should be sufficient.
I should like to see the EU push further ahead with this in the context of climate protection, and I hope that we can convince all the other major competing airlines to join this agreement.
My group believes that we should in fact do this as often as we possibly can. There is one category in which this it is difficult to do so and I intend to take this up again at a later stage.
I would have liked to hear from the Commission whether it would also be possible to discuss this with non-EU countries, but the Council is absent, unfortunately.
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically, resulting in a loss of jobs.
I fear however we have failed as an institution in the manner in which we have scrutinised the Prodi Commission, which has been unstructured, insufficiently in-depth and inconsistent.
For this very reason, it may be regarded as an important step forward that the European Parliament will shortly adopt the report on the gas market.
Mr Souaidia said that the generals, who are the real politicians and decision-makers, have killed thousands of people for no reason at all.
Mr Malerba and other Members have participated in such events in the past, and we very much hope that this practice will continue
I shall confine my speech this evening to some comments about the new stage that was reached on this road on Sunday 30 July, during the first round of the presidential elections, which coincided with the legislative elections.
My second point is that in Recital B, read it ladies and gentlemen, Western forces are forces of occupation.
Those with the fastest guns and the slowest reflexes to ideals and institutions cannot take the law into their own hands.
We await the results of this work with great interest.

I would like Baroness Ashton to tell me where she can offer consular assistance, as this is not always offered.
The frightening fact is that this technology exposes them to noise pollution at levels 200 billion times greater than that which we know already disturbs them, and so it is not really surprising that we are already seeing deaths from lung haemorrhages, from hearing loss and disruption of feeding, breeding and communication.
It is only after this that we review the Schengen system and look at how it can be adjusted or improved, because we can see that there are indeed problems with it, but let us stick to this order of things.
Left and right is only one dimension in politics.
Moreover, these issues of discrimination against women, children, homosexuals and migrants, and the continued existence of modern slavery, still affect a number of countries which pursue a policy of repression and refuse to allow themselves to be put in the dock.

The Commission has set out its views and presented a study which, if its recommendations were implemented, would result in a harmonisation of funding for individual Member States.
This is something that the groups’ spokesmen on environmental and climate issues should have nipped in the bud.
Last but not least, I would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone who assisted me in my work: the Information Society and Media Directorate General of the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism; I thank my fellow members of this House and those who are unable to be here today for their comments and proposals for amendments, and I thank the professional organisations for all their useful advice, invitations and explanations.
This is my maiden speech and I felt that I should be ill at ease with the meaning behind that thought.
It was in fact raised by the Austrian Foreign Minister during the informal meeting of foreign ministers. It was raised the day before yesterday by the Austrian Foreign Minister in Luxembourg and Doctor Wolfgang Schüssel will very probably take the opportunity afforded by his presence in Santa Maria da Feira to raise this issue.
Our limitations have recently made themselves painfully clear when dealing with conflicts of interest between Member States in the context of the northern gas pipeline project.

(ET) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although this is a shared sea, we have given it different names, and we must admit that we have not as yet come to see it as a shared space, or used all of its possibilities.
The time has come to check whether these laws and principles have also been translated into practice.
The result of that was that DG Press said that none of it was in order.
The Community's external links are currently divided between no less than six different services.
We have, rightly, embarked on a procedure for codifying such legislation - putting it in a single, readable, manageable text.
Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, including access to documents, remains essential in line with the negotiating framework.
In addition, I would point out that this is not a case of the EU lining up against the Philippines.
Is Mr Martinez aware, and are you Commissioner aware, of the fact that the AFSSA, the French food safety agency, has an annual budget of EUR 52 million and has a board of governors of whom 50% are appointed by the French government, the other 50% representing farmers, food retailers and food distributors?
We are going to continue to support energy saving, energy efficiency and renewable energies, and we are also spearheading the development of a methodology - an inevitably complex one, given the technical difficulties - to evaluate more precisely the carbon footprint of all the projects that we finance.
I believe that we must work to bring the positions of all the Member States closer together in this field, since, amongst other things, we are now, at the very least, an area of free movement of persons, goods etc.
I feel that we need to try to distribute the available funds so as to create more support than discontent, and I feel that this is very important for the image of culture at the European level.

It does not refer to the recognition of the Palestinian government or to the release of thousands of Lebanese and Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons.
I welcome what the report contains about providing contact points in all Member States to inform patients of the medical treatments available, how to apply for cross-border healthcare, and how to lodge a complaint or appeal.
But if the American Congress judges that this is inappropriate, would this then be illegal?
When we look back at the very short period during which we have worked on employment policy within the EU, we have to note that it has been relatively successful.
However, I am even sorrier about the numerous statements she made during the latter part of the campaign, which disputed the judgment of the International Court of Justice relating to the Black Sea continental shelf.
Greater freedom in defining countries' priorities will offer genuine opportunities for agricultural regions to develop.
Every single time, the reports are based on the idea that the European Parliament is perfect in its proficiency and therefore can and should charge the Commission and the Member States with the task of complying with its instructions.

The Commission has now presented an evaluation of its implementation and given an account of outstanding issues and future challenges.
Although the EU is by far the largest donor, it comes off far worse in terms of people' s perceptions than do the large multilateral organisations, such as the UN and the World Bank.
We stick to our original position because a non-response from a country cannot be considered as an indication that a prohibition is sought any more than it could be considered that a consent is given.
Parliament could conduct itself ad absurdum in this way.
The transposition of this, in a consistent and full way, is absolutely vital for its effective operation.
The procedure is acceptable since it consists of a package of measures rather than isolated proposals.

In our resolution, we are right to focus on the shortage of health workers, often caused by brain drain, a phenomenon whereby highly trained doctors and nurses decide to work elsewhere in the world.
Such behaviour only underlines the fact that it is only with independence - the normal status of independence - that Scotland can properly contribute to the international community, and I hope that the European Council will very soon be discussing internal enlargement of the European Union, with Scotland leading the way.
Affordability must in each case take the groups and regions with the lowest incomes as the point of reference.
The problem, Mr President, is obviously the question of how these European parties should be connected.
B5-0614/2000 by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, on behalf of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on Iraq;
- (LT) Commissioner, if a wealthy and economically stable nation such as Sweden is unable to introduce the euro, I cannot but question the future of the euro zone project.
I scarcely regard that as acceptable, and that is why I repeat that I wish to avoid the reconciliation procedure, but not at any cost!
Madam President, I refuse to accept that there must inevitably be a technology gap between generations, between social strata, between those who are 'switched on' and those who are not, between those whose life and work will derive maximum benefit from digital technology and those for whom such technology will remain an object of fear and a threat to their place in society.
That is rather fragile.
Additional expenses which the new rules entail, if they put the operation of certain airports at risk, should be reimbursed, whereby, however, the principle applies that in the medium term, the costs must be borne by the users and the sector.
That does not mean, however, that we can turn a blind eye to human rights abuses.
Its scope cannot be reduced to a simple market-harmonisation or competitiveness problem.

We are interested in having sound foundations so that we do not just lurch from one problem to the next, but so that we can work together on a solid basis for years to come, because the problem in the Balkans is not a problem which can be solved in a year.
Greater stability means more controls, it means intervening promptly and effectively, and it means making the most of competitiveness.
The Fifth Report on Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion takes excellent account of these factors, and it is also very important that we invest more time and money in success.

In the medium term, I am also in favour of the Commission proposal to create a special assistance fund for natural, technological and environmental disasters with a value of no less than EUR one billion.
I suggest to the House that the Commission keep itself fully informed of developments relating to the inquiry and that it keeps the Committee on Fisheries fully informed.
It would certainly be wrong simply to throw a European solution over them and accommodate everything under it.

insisted on increasing the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund;
A lot of the interventions focused on taking a very serious view of and putting a very high priority on the provisions of public health which were set out both in the Maastricht and in the Amsterdam Treaties, and I would like to think that perhaps in the next framework we could take a rather wide interpretation of what is involved in the Amsterdam Treaty in preparing our new framework.
The situation is extremely delicate and sensitive: the country is experiencing a general crisis - economic, financial, social, political and even military. That is why we placed Guinea-Bissau on this week's agenda.
But I do believe that the Commission communication is a start, and we should try to take full advantage of all possibilities within the European Union.
It also serves, however, as a reminder to the international community of the need for reform in China.
I think we should speak openly about both of these forms of totalitarianism.

The area of freedom, security and justice must be backed up by a solid guarantee of the respect for rights corresponding to the realities of contemporary society, which is in line with the open and innovative approach which this Parliament wishes to see.
This is clearly a situation in which people who are defending the universal declaration of human rights are being denied the right they are guaranteed under that declaration to leave and to return to their own country.
Now let us turn to the future for a moment.
This, I believe, is discrimination against one Member State and one language.
I should like to know what has happened to the thinking behind the rational planning in the gas and electricity distribution sectors draft directive.
We would have a common target for investment here: gas, which we badly need and whose new production and satellite regions in the north are quite near us.
How can it be that Parliament is not asserting its representative role so as to demand that its initiatives be endorsed as a matter of course by the Commission?

That is the acid test.
The business lunch or dinner is valuable when it comes to fostering contacts and building up client confidence - especially for small companies, who can also use the occasion to present their products.
Let us move on to actions.
(FR) Mr President, at the time of the legislative elections in 2006, I asked a Palestinian: 'Do you think that these elections will bring peace?'
Thus, the tensions will increase, and we require new legislative and financial instruments and a powerful EU strategy for us to succeed in managing oil in a fair and sustainable way.

This was very clear in Mr Winkler's speech.

Thirdly, macro-financial assistance shall be supplementary to the resources provided by the IMF and other multilateral institutions.
In order to retain its leadership, Europe will have to demonstrate an innovative approach to the climate issue and offer something other than the sole target of a global reduction in emissions via the highly speculative system of a market for greenhouse gas emissions, a tool that the US Government has, moreover, just rejected.
The intention was to cover an amount of EUR 342 million, potentially subject to the n+2 rule.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the opportunity which the Eurodac System will afford us in terms of fighting the current abuse of the asylum application system, for a great number of reasons, must be welcomed.
Once more, my thanks for this, and my thanks once more to every one of you.
He was critical of the judgement of the German Federal Constitutional Court of October 1993 concerning the draft Maastricht Treaty: the author did not share the basis of his assertion that the passing of power to the European Community would potentially constitute a deprivation of the democratic principle.
It is true that this is also not the way to dialogue, although they are not aimed towards Russia.
This is explained by the fact that, following the collapse of the Soviet regime, he has replaced a succession of ephemeral governments which had exasperated the Belorusian population by, firstly, privatising everything left, right and centre, including even essential public services which thereupon came under the control of Western firms and, secondly and above all, by attempting to detach Belarus from Russia, something to which the Belorusian people could not consent.
My group does not accept the compromise that the Presidency and the rapporteur laboriously arrived at, not because we are opposed to a European return policy but because we feel that the result is very inadequate as regards protecting fundamental rights.
I think even a climate sceptic like Mr Wilson should take care of citizens and support energy efficiency and efforts to decrease the energy bill.
However, although I acknowledge that the report outlines the difference in treatment to be afforded to high-sea fisheries and smaller-scale fisheries, it is lamentable that any more expense be imposed upon the latter particularly.
It turned out to be beneficial for the new Member States, but I warn you that the social unrest it may cause may mean that we will go from bad to worse, and the directive would not only lead to social unrest, it would also undo the good work.
. (PT) It is our view that policies for protecting the environment and natural resources are crucial to sustainable development.
Industry cannot guarantee that we shall have alternatives available by 2010 which will meet the specific and extremely demanding safety standards for aircraft tyres.

We wish to avoid completely the situation whereby these regulations end up having less of an impact in terms of simplification as compared to the Commission's initial proposal.
The third issue is how different countries receive asylum seekers and which countries are chosen.
They will not fall as a result of the adoption of these two paragraphs.
For my part, I am convinced that, in the present situation, the best way is that of continued work by the weapons inspectors, quite simply because military intervention is always the last resort.
(NL) Mr President, the new Treaty of Lisbon has made energy the shared responsibility of the EU and the Member States.
However, we must insist that political and religious prisoners are released.
It surely cannot be right, when everyone believes that Europe's purpose in this market organisation, in everything we do in the banana business, is to protect the small and independent growers against the large multinationals, if we table an amendment to precisely that effect, specifying that support payments are to be made to small and independent growers and not to multinational concerns, and if this amendment is then rejected.
The recommendations in the motion for a resolution and the specific proposals for certain changes or addenda to the Commission proposal will, we hope, help to formulate a position which is also politically acceptable to the Council for the preparation of a reliable budget for the period 2007-2013.
The proposal therefore singles out the measures which should be given top priority for adoption at EU level in order to solve some of the outstanding problems.
Her report makes provision for this and I support it.
The Court does not define 'non-significant' .

The Spanish Government and the Mauritanian Government have begun to cooperate, but I hope that the European Union, and specifically the Commission and the Council, will adopt measures to help resolve this great human tragedy very soon.
This Commission communication highlights new challenges in relation to Internet usage: broadband is needed to stimulate new services; schools are connected but the Internet is not yet sufficiently part of the pedagogical process; governments online have to move towards full electronic transactions.
The report of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy boosts these intentions as far as the centralisation of energy policy and the strengthening of the EU's powers in the field are concerned.
Mr President, this is something which cannot wait.
I must say that I support the criticism of the Commissioner&#x02BC;s supervision of the fifth programme of measures of the environment.
Some people in Britain were worried some years ago by the level of immigration from the Indian sub-continent.
It does not prevent a single Member State from making better regulations.
In fact, this proposal for a recommendation is a consequence of the rejection of the Danish and Greek initiatives and is the corollary to the purely imaginary exercise and the game of make-believe that both rapporteurs have been peddling.
The international community needs to address how to frame a UN Security Council resolution or resolutions on Iraq.
The networks are in daily contact and allow for the timely exchange of information, laying the ground for rapid action.
Will she now add this to her list and give us an undertaking that she will fight to try and ensure that this partnership agreement is suspended?
Having said that, although our debates are programmed into the agenda, it is impossible to predict exactly how long they will last, give or take a few minutes or a quarter of an hour, not least because the Commissioners and the ministers sometimes take up much more speaking time than the sitting staff plan for.
The conclusion of the summit should see an affirmation of objectives, namely the promotion of stability, well being and solidarity in the region, the presentation of an agenda for coordinated action for a stable, participative democracy, for economic cooperation, for integration and development and last but certainly not least for cooperation on environmental protection.
It is commonly known that the army is largely responsible for crimes and serious violation of human rights.
I very much hope that a diplomatic solution can be found here.
Within the Italian national anthem is the line ‘’, which – I will say it for the benefit of the interpreters – means ‘let us all join together for the coming battles’.
Because when you made your proposals back in January, and we studied them carefully, it was clear that the Commission' s appointment policy - and that is how we put it then - is a matter for the Commission and we should not interfere with it, unless there is obvious cause for this.
We have seen this strategy succeed in former dictatorships in Southern Europe, we shall see it work in Eastern and Central Europe, and it ought also to work in Turkey.
I referred to these in my previous reply.
The debate is closed.
This health check is not a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy.
I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets Chairman Mr Böge, the shadow rapporteurs and coordinators of the political groups, my colleagues and the advisors and employees of the Budget Committee who took part in most of the discussions.
The European farming sector is of socio-economic importance, particularly in terms of ensuring the security of food supply and in terms of promoting rural communities and the environment.
Perhaps, as I said before, we should deal with the definition before the procedure.
I am not talking about being tired of having to deal with this subject, but about being tired at the lack of results, despite constant pressure from this Parliament.
The Commission’s first response was confined to EUR 30 million, which Commissioner Barnier himself recognised as falling well short of expectations and requirements.
The Commission will, of course, invite Member States and international authorities to share information on their findings and approaches and to discuss any proposed follow-up actions resulting from the opinion provided by the independent scientific experts.
I am delighted that Poland was one of the countries that put forward this initiative.
The Global Approach to Migration, which was adopted by the European Council in December 2005, still forms the basic framework for defining the response to these challenges.
Mr President, it is a case of better late than never as far as the Commission is concerned!
If my report has given rise to some differences of opinion, they are never about the objective, only about what we consider to be the most appropriate means of achieving that objective.
From the beginning, the Commission has supported the idea of shared management.
Could I suggest further to Mrs Green that she takes another look at the figures because the figures I saw this morning showed that Mr Blair lost by 13 votes.
Madam President, allow me to start by using a military analogy in these times of war.
Such reallocation is best dealt with in the context of the issuing and renewal of licences.
We also believe that the economic and social governance of the Union should be turned into a reality, which means that the progress made in the first part of the Constitution should be reflected in the third part, dedicated to the Union’s policies, and furthermore that the legal basis for the protection and development of public services must be maintained, and then it will be able to be enshrined in a framework law.
The reason is that we have to explain this policy to our citizens who are full of concern: they should not be afraid of immigration as such, but of those who commit crimes.
We believe that was the correct thing to do, but that the Commission should have simultaneously taken action against the Member State in question and required it to comply with the relevant standards.
I call on the Commission to use the review to examine whether or not and how the introduction of a single passport per person has contributed to a decrease in the number of child abductions.
The EU has a duty towards the citizens of its Member States, and as a member of the international community, to play a unique role in its immediate sphere of influence.
We also have soils which have been taken out of agricultural production.
   . – Mr President, it is a striking coincidence that this afternoon should find us discussing air and maritime safety.
We now need to understand what is realistic and feasible at this stage.
We cannot pretend that the European Constitution was not rejected by the French and the Dutch.
Protection against specified zoonoses
Let us not fear expanding the Union as a result of the accession of the next few states.
If the current rate of growth is maintained, the improvements needed to compensate for the anticipated environmental impact of the increase in air traffic will not be made.
It is salutary to recall that over 60 000 people have been killed during the course of this conflict - people in both ethnic groups.

The Commission welcomes the Government's intention to allow the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees access to the boat people.

(Applause)
It is an operation begun immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet Union.
Secondly, let us consider home-grown players.
Let me now briefly list and address a few of the major development problems that occur in all the target regions, meaning all the German target regions.
There is a risk of contradictions between establishing the very long-term basis of those kinds of deals and the liberalisation of the gas market inside the Union, to which we would give priority.

Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged 35 to 55.
We know that online shopping is a contemporary phenomenon, but that the laws that govern it are behind the times, and now it is time to move on.
It is extremely important that the entry into force of this directive should not be retroactive and, consequently, that no provision derived from this act can be applied to drivers already working in the profession.
Europe, which is not only a trading bloc, but also one of values and standards, is an area that could make a huge impact on that level.
I also agree with the rapporteur that it would be necessary, on this as on other aspects of environmental policy, since there are regulations, directives and decisions, to simplify and consolidate the legislation.
The European Parliament has a reputation to maintain when it comes to the protection of civil rights, particularly in recent years.
From a dialectical point of view, they have presented us with a very simple problem, or so it would seem.
This systematic approach was applied across all services and the information provided was then carefully screened for extra certainty.
This means that there must be recognition of the need to implement an effective Action Plan in order to ensure appropriate linkages between the approaches and initiatives of the different Member States and the EU regarding the prevention of, detection of, preparation for and response to CBRN incidents.
As it is the Member States which in the final analysis will implement the proposed freezing of suspected terrorists' financial assets and as this must in any case be carried out through measures within each Member State, there is nothing to suggest that an EU regulation is required or that it will speed up the implementation of necessary measures.
All this is highly surprising.
There was no crisis mechanism, either temporary or stable, and there were no strong institutions to provide financial supervision.
We have looked at this in detail in the Constitutional Committee, and the committee's opinions were fairly evenly divided.
We must act, as I have said, to implement bans within the Member States to ensure that the most contaminating products are transported in more secure vessels, to guarantee that these are monitored to the highest possible degree; but we also need to act immediately, while knowing that this will only bear fruit in the medium term, at international level, to promote change in international maritime law.
I firmly believe that the veterinary authorities, the Member States and the Commission have been working together very closely and effectively.
Mr König, we have made far less progress in this area than you seemed to suggest.
It not just aircraft noise, which has very rightly been highlighted, and noise from factories that we are talking about.

Clear strategies and plans need to be in place now if they are to have any effect.
Mr President, Mr Bösch's report on the independence of UCLAF has been taken off the agenda.
This policy has been pursued by the Italian Government, with varying degrees of success, but it now appears that this approach is coming in for criticism from the Commission.
There were two reasons for that.
However, the dynamic provided by the efforts of Martti Ahtisaari in determining the status of Kosovo is helping us to inject more hope as well as the spirit and methods of the European Union into the lives of all the inhabitants of this region.
Of course, both good and bad things might be said about such negotiations, but the fact is that there is no question of objectivity.
This is also key for close cooperation between the different directorates in the Commission and DG External Relations.
Another saying we have at home is 'at least no one died', but this is no longer true: people are dying.
All in all, the Commission left a great deal to be desired in its handling of the BSE crisis, and committed serious errors and omissions.
To those, on one side or the other, furthermore, who would have us choose between growth and justice, we would answer that we refuse to choose between growth and justice, or justice and growth.
Subsidiarity is about having scope to take your own decisions on a local basis, so that things may perhaps be different in Bavaria - where I come from - from what they are in, say, Luxembourg, where the Commissioner comes from, or in Spain, Portugal, Greece or, in future perhaps, in Lithuania.
It undermines the foundations of the EU and, moreover, it is always the smaller countries who have to suffer, as this case has proven once again.
This heightened awareness is also needed if the directive is to be transposed. Transposition is currently incomplete.
I would just like to draw attention to two specific features of the SAVE II programme which are truly worth bearing in mind.
At the same time, I am following with great attention the repeated efforts of the Commission and certain other parties, for whom the proposed target seems, on the contrary, rather unambitious, to reopen the debate on this topic and to try and change this regulation in order to set more stringent targets.
You mentioned it yourself and it is cautious and to my mind, quite inadequate.
And, furthermore, you say this as a representative of a political party which is illegal in Spain, which defends terrorists and kills those of us who defend our ideas.
I would also like to thank Parliament for its dedication and cooperation, which have given great impetus to the European Union's policy on immigration and asylum during the almost five months of the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the Union.
The tax dispute has already been touched on.
I ask: Why should not it?
The right to health is after all considered to be a fundamental right in all the EU Member States, and one that is conferred on the basis of solidarity.
Well done again to Mr Coelho on his report.
The next item is the report (A4-0260/98) by Mrs van Dijk, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, on the report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the state of women's health in the European Community (COM(97)0224 - C4-0333/97).
If things go well, we will end up with ever-decreasing quantities of waste.
Overall, I support the proposal, even if I have one fundamental criticism of it.
The substances that have been allowed into food must be approved, and active packaging must not be misleading to consumers.
As regards the proposed Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, we realise that life for people with disabilities would be very positively affected were the Commission's proposal to become a reality.
On the contrary, political actions also have to be undertaken, beginning with a programme of initiatives designed to manage the flow of growing economic emigration towards, inevitably, our own countries that sometimes constitutes an undeniable advantage for the European economy.
Subject: Arrest of the leader of the Chilean Communist Party for insulting General Pinochet
All the conditions seem to me to be in place - I say that in all conscience, but I may be wrong - for me to propose the inclusion of this item on the agenda under Rule 111.
It was said to be a measure to promote tourism.
Also, perhaps, some thought should be given to the relationship with national parliaments.
Can you guarantee that the Commission will not use qualified majority voting on any of those issues?
I would also like to highlight the part concerning fair competition with third countries, because in the past, we have been too permissive in this area, and entire basic sectors, such as the Tuscan textile sector, for instance - and I am quite sure of this because I am from Prato - have been brought to their knees by unfair competition that should certainly have been stopped and prevented at source.
Schools, and especially girls' schools, are being burnt down or forced to close, bridges and roads are being blown up.
Finally, energy efficiency will not create high quality jobs unless it is based on a genuine EU strategic industrial initiative which is free of the constraints of the free market.
At the General Affairs Council of 24 February 1997, a number of Member States sought to involve the Turkish Cypriots in the negotiations on the accession of Cyprus to the EU, thus placing the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot 'State' established in the northern part of the island following the Turkish military invasion in 1974 on an equal footing, contrary to the conclusions of the UN and the EU, according to which there is but one legal and recognized government in Cyprus.
I wanted to ask if you currently have more detailed and more specific information available on the question of the guidelines which the European Commission will issue as regards public and private investment within the framework of Barcelona II, because the water sector is a very important sector for the quality of life and equal development which we want to achieve in the Mediterranean basin.
There are tens of thousands of sports clubs, numerous associations and federations; there are sports movements, and the entire sporting community is essentially one of the great popular movements within the European Union.
Zoning of our rather urbanised regions is to be possible, thus improving practicability without compromising our ultimate objectives.
About 7 million overseas tourists visit Ireland every year.
Enlargement of the European Union in all its stages meant it acquired new neighbours.
While welcoming the Commission communication on Innovation Union as a flagship initiative of the EU 2020 strategy for growth and jobs, I think there are still priority areas where we need a greater commitment to building capacities in science, technology and innovation: efficient resource use, recovery and recycling of waste, food quality and safety, and new epidemics.
There is no logic to this whatsoever!
It involves giving priority to diplomatic and preventive action, supporting governments as they fulfil their obligation to protect their own people, and applying appropriate pressure where necessary. The latter could include diplomatic and economic sanctions.
in writing. - (FI) The European Union is full of big words. Once again this morning they have been used to speak about the Lisbon Strategy.
Of course, my group' s vote will depend on the outcome of the vote on the committee' s amendments and also on the amendments that will be proposed tomorrow.
In the new Treaty, however, things are set to change, in that Parliament is given formal consultation rights and the right to adequate information.
In my report I call for a comprehensive scheme of incentives and training for fishermen in the use of conservation technology to be included in any package of measures as a matter of urgency.
I agree that 2009 will be a watershed year for the functioning of the European institutions. I am optimistic, however, that this fact will not get in the way of implementing key objectives for the year.
This House has repeatedly and clearly opposed this and called for an external chamber for budgetary discipline to be established at the European Court of Auditors or Court of Justice, which should be called in whenever the financial accountability of officials is at issue.
Looking at the global aspect of this challenge, the first and most important point of criticism is the pathetic level of official development assistance, which is now 0.24%, far from the 0.7% that was promised.
